Although high-functioning individuals with autistic disorder (i.e. autism and Asperger
syndrome) are of normal intelligence, they have life-long abnormalities in social
communication and emotional behaviour. However, the biological basis of social difficulties
in autism is poorly understood. Facial expressions help shape behaviour, and we investigated
if high-functioning people with autistic disorder show neurobiological differences
from controls when processing emotional facial expressions. We used functional MRI
to investigate brain activity in nine adults with autistic disorder (mean age +/-
standard deviation 37 +/- 7 years; IQ 102 +/- 15) and nine controls (27 +/- 7 years;
IQ 116 +/- 10) when explicitly (consciously) and implicitly (unconsciously) processing
emotional facial expressions. Subjects with autistic disorder differed significantly
from controls in the activity of cerebellar, mesolimbic and temporal lobe cortical
regions of the brain when processing facial expressions. Notably, they did not activate
a cortical 'face area' when explicitly appraising expressions, or the left amygdala
region and left cerebellum when implicitly processing emotional facial expressions.
High-functioning people with autistic disorder have biological differences from controls
when consciously and unconsciously processing facial emotions, and these differences
are most likely to be neurodevelopmental in origin. This may account for some of the
abnormalities in social behaviour associated with autism.
