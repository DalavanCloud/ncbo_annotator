Functional neuroimaging studies on patients with depression have found abnormal activity
in the left prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex compared with healthy controls.
Other studies have shown that these regions become active in healthy subjects during
verbal fluency tasks, while patients with depression show impaired performance on
such tasks. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate changes in
cerebral blood oxygenation associated with a verbal fluency task in depressed patients
and healthy volunteers. In contrast to 10 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects
who activated the left prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex during
word generation, 10 depressed subjects showed attenuated activation in the left prefrontal
cortex and did not show significant activation in the anterior cingulate cortex. These
findings suggest that impaired performance during verbal fluency task in depressed
patients is associated with abnormal neural responses within these regions.Copyright
