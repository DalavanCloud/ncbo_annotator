Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare cortical activation patterns
in healthy volunteers with those in patients with schizophrenia during a modified
verbal Stroop task. Healthy subjects (n=13) and patients with schizophrenia (n=13)
on stable antipsychotic treatment, matched on demographic variables, were included.
Patients were preselected on the basis of good performance on a selective attention
test. Patients with schizophrenia showed a significantly increased pattern of activation
in the left and right inferior frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. A
significant negative correlation between activation of the left prefrontal cortex
and accuracy in the modified Stroop test was observed for healthy controls but not
schizophrenia patients. Although both groups recruited the prefrontal cortex during
the modified Stroop task, for the schizophrenia patients this activation was bilateral,
whereas for the controls this activation was primarily in the left hemisphere, suggesting
that patients with schizophrenia recruited more prefrontal regions to perform the
task with the same accuracy as healthy controls. Our findings of increased activity
across multiple areas of the brain, including dorsolateral frontal cortex and anterior
cingulate, in patients with schizophrenia who perform relatively well on a task of
selective attention give further evidence that task performance may be a confounding
factor in the interpretation of neuroimaging results.
