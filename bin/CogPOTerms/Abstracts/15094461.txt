Word reading is considered a highly over-learned task. If true, then practice should
have no effect on its performance or associated functional brain anatomy. We tested
this hypothesis in two experiments of skilled readers repeatedly reading the same
list of nouns (1 session, 10 runs). In Experiment 1 we used fMRI to monitor the changes
in brain activity. In Experiment 2 we recorded voice onset latency reaction times.
Neither experiment showed changes as an effect of practice. In a third experiment,
Experiment 3, we examined the behavioral effect of prolonged practice on the word
association task of verb generation for which reading nouns aloud has served as a
control. Both short (1 session, 10 runs) and long term (15 days, 150 runs) effects
were noted providing a new perspective on functional anatomical differences between
word reading and verb generation previously noted after short periods of practice.
