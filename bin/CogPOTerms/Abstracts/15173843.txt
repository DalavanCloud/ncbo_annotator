The symptoms of bipolar disorder suggest dysfunction of anterior limbic networks that
modulate emotional behavior and that reciprocally interact with dorsal attentional
systems. Bipolar patients maintain a constant vulnerability to mood episodes even
during euthymia, when symptoms are minimal. Consequently, we predicted that, compared
with healthy subjects, bipolar patients would exhibit abnormal activation of regions
of the anterior limbic network with corresponding abnormal activation of other cortical
areas involved in attentional processing. In all, 10 unmedicated euthymic bipolar
patients and 10 group-matched healthy subjects were studied with fMRI while performing
the Continuous Performance Task-Identical Pairs version (CPT-IP). fMRI scans were
obtained on a 3.0 T Bruker system using an echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence,
while subjects performed the CPT-IP and a control condition to contrast group differences
in regional brain activation. The euthymic bipolar and healthy subjects performed
similarly on the CPT-IP, yet showed significantly different patterns of brain activation.
Specifically, bipolar patients exhibited increased activation of limbic, paralimbic,
and ventrolateral prefrontal areas, as well as visual associational cortices. Healthy
subjects exhibited relatively increased activation in fusiform gyrus and medial prefrontal
cortex. In conclusion, these differences suggest that bipolar patients exhibit overactivation
of anterior limbic areas with corresponding abnormal activation in visual associational
cortical areas, permitting successful performance of an attentional task. Since the
differences occurred in euthymia, they may represent trait, rather than state, abnormalities
of brain function in bipolar disorder.
