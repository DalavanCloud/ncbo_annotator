Impaired prefrontal cortical function is regarded as a central feature of schizophrenia.
Although many neuroimaging studies have found evidence of abnormal prefrontal activation
when patients with schizophrenia perform cognitive tasks, the extent to which this
abnormality depends on the presence of active psychotic symptoms and on the demands
of the task is unclear. The authors tested the hypothesis that prefrontal functional
abnormalities in schizophrenia would be more evident in patients with active psychosis
than in patients who were in remission and would become more apparent in the face
of increasing task demands.The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to examine prefrontal cortical activity during a paced letter verbal fluency
task in three groups of subjects: acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia, schizophrenia
patients in remission, and healthy volunteers. Online subject performance was measured
by utilizing a clustered fMRI acquisition sequence that allowed overt verbal responses
to be made in the relative absence of scanner noise.Patients with schizophrenia showed
less activation than the healthy comparison subjects in the anterior cingulate and
the inferior frontal and right middle frontal cortices, independent of psychotic state
and task demand. Acutely psychotic patients showed less activation than the healthy
comparison subjects, but these differences were less marked than the differences between
the patients in remission and the healthy comparison subjects. Acutely psychotic patients
had less activation than the comparison subjects in the anterior cingulate but no
significant difference in lateral prefrontal activation. Increasing task demand led
to greater anterior cingulate and middle frontal activation in patients with active
psychosis than in patients in remission.Schizophrenia is associated with impaired
prefrontal function, but its manifestation depends on the severity of psychotic symptoms
and the level of task difficulty.
