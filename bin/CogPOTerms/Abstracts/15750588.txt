Diminished gaze fixation is one of the core features of autism and has been proposed
to be associated with abnormalities in the neural circuitry of affect. We tested this
hypothesis in two separate studies using eye tracking while measuring functional brain
activity during facial discrimination tasks in individuals with autism and in typically
developing individuals. Activation in the fusiform gyrus and amygdala was strongly
and positively correlated with the time spent fixating the eyes in the autistic group
in both studies, suggesting that diminished gaze fixation may account for the fusiform
hypoactivation to faces commonly reported in autism. In addition, variation in eye
fixation within autistic individuals was strongly and positively associated with amygdala
activation across both studies, suggesting a heightened emotional response associated
with gaze fixation in autism.
