Recent work suggests that episodic memory deficits in schizophrenia may be related
to disturbances of encoding or retrieval. Schizophrenia patients appear to benefit
from instruction in episodic memory strategies. We tested the hypothesis that providing
effective encoding strategies to schizophrenia patients enhances encoding-related
brain activity and recognition performance.Seventeen schizophrenia patients and 26
healthy comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans
while performing incidental encoding tasks of words and faces. Subjects were required
to make either deep (abstract/concrete) or shallow (alphabetization) judgments for
words and deep (gender) judgments for faces, followed by subsequent recognition tests.Schizophrenia
and comparison subjects recognized significantly more words encoded deeply than shallowly,
activated regions in inferior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 45/47) typically associated
with deep and successful encoding of words, and showed greater left frontal activation
for the processing of words compared with faces. However, during deep encoding and
material-specific processing (words vs. faces), participants with schizophrenia activated
regions not activated by control subjects, including several in prefrontal cortex.Our
findings suggest that a deficit in use of effective strategies influences episodic
memory performance in schizophrenia and that abnormalities in functional brain activation
persist even when such strategies are applied.
