Working memory, a critical cognitive capacity that is affected in schizophrenia, can
be divided into maintenance and manipulation processes. Previous behavioral research
suggested that manipulation is more affected than maintenance in patients with chronic
schizophrenia. In this study of first-episode schizophrenia patients, the authors
evaluated the extent to which the two working memory processes are affected early
in the course of schizophrenia.Study subjects were 11 first-episode schizophrenia
patients and 11 matched healthy comparison subjects. Each group performed two verbal
working memory tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. One task
required maintenance of information; the other required manipulation of information
in addition to maintenance.Under behaviorally matched conditions, both groups activated
a predominantly left-sided frontal-parietal network. The manipulation plus maintenance
task elicited activation of greater magnitude and spatial extent. With both tasks,
patients showed less bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation and greater
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation, relative to the comparison subjects. A
group-by-task interaction was observed for activation at the left dorsolateral and
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The increase in activation when patients engaged
in the manipulation plus maintenance task was disproportionately less in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex and greater in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.These functional
neuroanatomical findings add support to earlier suggestions that manipulation of information
is selectively more affected than maintenance of information in persons with schizophrenia.
They also suggest the presence of interacting regions of dysfunctional and compensatory
prefrontal responses in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively,
that are more prominent when information is manipulated. This disrupted prefrontal
network is present relatively early in the course of schizophrenia.
