The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) includes disturbances in several
neuroanatomical substrates and neurotransmitter systems. The challenge is to elucidate
the brain mechanisms of MDD behavioral symptoms, chiefly those of anhedonia.To visualize
the neuroanatomical substrates implicated in altered reward processing in MDD, using
functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with a dopaminergic probe (a
30-mg dose of oral dextroamphetamine sulfate) to stimulate the brain reward system;
and to test the hypothesis that a hypersensitive response to dextroamphetamine in
MDD involves the prefrontal cortex and the striatum.Among subjects with MDD and healthy
control subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before
and after single-blind administration of dextroamphetamine.Subjects were recruited
through local newspaper advertisements and by word of mouth.Twelve depressed subjects
(mean age, 34.83 years; male-female ratio, 6:6) met criteria for MDD according to
the DSM-IV, were not taking antidepressants, and had no comorbid Axis I disorders.
Twelve control subjects (mean age, 29.33 years; male-female ratio, 5:7) were healthy
volunteers without a history of Axis I disorders.Functional magnetic resonance imaging
blood oxygen level-dependent activation was measured during a controlled task, and
dextroamphetamine-induced subjective effects were assessed using the Addiction Research
Center Inventory.Subjects with MDD had a hypersensitive response to the rewarding
effects of dextroamphetamine (2-fold increase; t(21) = 2.74, P = .01), with altered
brain activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex
and the caudate and putamen (F(1,44) = 11.93, P = .001).Dopamine-related neuroanatomical
substrates are involved in altered reward processing in MDD, shedding light on the
neurobiology of the anhedonic symptoms in MDD and suggesting these substrates as future
therapeutic targets.
