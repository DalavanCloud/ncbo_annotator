The present study is aimed to examine the neuronal correlates of Stroop interference
in medication-free patients with major depressive disorder.Sixteen patients fulfilling
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for unipolar
depression and 16 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, and education
were included. All subjects underwent an event-related functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) design with an adapted version of the Stroop task including congruent
and incongruent task conditions. The fMRI experiment was conducted on a 1.5 T magnetic
resonance (MR) scanner, and item responses were given manually by the subjects.With
regard to behavioral performance, patients revealed no differences in both reaction
time and accuracy relative to control subjects. With regard to brain activations,
direct comparison of patients with control subjects in the interference condition
revealed hyperactivity in rostral anterior cingulate gyrus (rACG) and left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in depressive patients, which correlated strongly with the
Stroop interference.The study provides new evidence for the functioning and dissociation
of the anterior cingulate in depressed patients. The greater prefrontal activation
may reflect a cortical inefficiency due to hyperactivity in rACG enhancing the cognitive
interferences from the emotional state.
