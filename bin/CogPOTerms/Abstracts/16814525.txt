Patients with schizophrenia tend to have impaired source monitoring and intact item
recognition, suggesting an over-reliance of familiarity effects. We previously demonstrated
that providing patients with a levels-of-processing (LOP) semantic encoding strategy
normalized source monitoring. The current blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study tests the hypothesis that patients will have
abnormally increased fronto-temporal activation despite intact performance. fMRI was
measured in 13 patients and 13 demographically matched healthy controls during a LOP
source monitoring paradigm. SPM2 was used for standard pre-processing and statistical
analyses, with a corrected significance threshold of p&lt;.05. Examination of accuracy
and speed measures did not reveal any group differences in task performance. Regardless
of source retrieval success both groups activated expected prefrontal and parietal
regions, with no areas of relatively greater control versus patient activation. In
support of the hypothesis, patients showed abnormally increased activation in temporolimbic
areas including middle and superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, and parahippocampal
gyrus. Activation in these areas was associated with worse positive and negative symptoms,
but did not correlate with performance, suggesting inefficient rather than compensatory
activation.
