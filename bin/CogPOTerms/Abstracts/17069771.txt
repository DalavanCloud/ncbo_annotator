The broad autism phenotype includes subclinical autistic characteristics found to
have a higher prevalence in unaffected family members of individuals with autism.
These characteristics primarily affect the social aspects of language, communication,
and human interaction. The current research focuses on possible neurobehavioral characteristics
associated with the broad autism phenotype.We used a face-processing task associated
with atypical patterns of gaze fixation and brain function in autism while collecting
brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking in unaffected
siblings of individuals with autism.We found robust differences in gaze fixation and
brain function in response to images of human faces in unaffected siblings compared
with typically developing control individuals. The siblings' gaze fixations and brain
activation patterns during the face processing task were similar to that of the autism
group and showed decreased gaze fixation along with diminished fusiform activation
compared with the control group. Furthermore, amygdala volume in the siblings was
similar to the autism group and was significantly reduced compared with the control
group.Together, these findings provide compelling evidence for differences in social/emotional
processing and underlying neural circuitry in siblings of individuals with autism,
supporting the notion of unique endophenotypes associated with the broad autism phenotype.
