Neuroimaging studies of emotional response in schizophrenia have mainly used visual
(faces) paradigms and shown globally reduced brain activity. None of these studies
have used an auditory paradigm. Our principal aim is to evaluate the emotional response
of patients with schizophrenia to neutral and emotional words. An auditory emotional
paradigm based on the most frequent words heard by psychotic patients with auditory
hallucinations was designed. This paradigm was applied to evaluate cerebral activation
with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 11 patients with schizophrenia
with persistent hallucinations and 10 healthy subjects. We found a clear enhanced
activity of the frontal lobe, temporal cortex, insula, cingulate, and amygdala (mainly
right side) in patients when hearing emotional words in comparison with controls.
Our findings are consistent with other studies suggesting a relevant role for emotional
response in the pathogenesis and treatment of auditory hallucinations.
