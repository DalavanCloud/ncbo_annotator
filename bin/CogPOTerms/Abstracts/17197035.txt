Executive deficits associated with frontal lobe dysfunction are prominent in depression.
We applied a newly developed WM task to investigate the neural correlates of executive
processes with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at comparable performance
levels analyzing correct trials only.We studied 12 partially remitted, medicated inpatients
meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and 17 healthy controls. We
used a parametric version of a delayed match-to-sample WM task requiring manipulation
of verbal material during a delay period in an event-related fMRI design.Depressed
patients were generally slower and load-dependently less accurate than healthy controls.
Patients showed significantly more activation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
with highest cognitive load. Additionally, they showed higher activation in ventromedial
prefrontal cortex during the control condition.The fact that patients were taking
different antidepressant drugs could limit the explanatory power of the present results.Increased
lateral prefrontal activation despite comparably successful performance - when only
correct trials were analyzed - in patients with depression can be interpreted as evidence
for compensatory recruitment of prefrontal cortical resources.
