Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by cognitive control deficits as well
as impairments in social interactions. However, the brain mechanisms mediating the
interactive effects of these deficits have not been addressed. We employed event-related
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of processing
directional information from faces on activity within brain regions mediating cognitive
control. High-functioning individuals with autism and age-, gender-, and IQ-matched
neurotypical individuals attended to the direction of a centrally-presented arrow
or gaze stimulus with similar flanker stimuli oriented in the same ("congruent") or
opposite ("incongruent") direction. The incongruent arrow condition was examined to
assess functioning of brain regions mediating cognitive control in a context without
social-cognitive demands, whereas the incongruent gaze condition assessed functioning
of the same brain regions in a social-cognitive context. Consistent with prior studies,
the incongruent arrow condition recruited activity in bilateral midfrontal gyrus,
right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral intraparietal sulcus, and the anterior cingulate
relative to the congruent arrow condition in neurotypical participants. Notably, there
were not diagnostic group differences in patterns of regional fMRI activation in response
to the arrow condition. However, while viewing the incongruent gaze stimuli, although
neurotypical participants recruited the same brain regions, participants with autism
showed marked hypoactivation in these areas. These findings suggest that processing
social-cognitive stimuli interferes with functioning of brain regions recruited during
cognitive control tasks in autism. Implications for research into cognitive control
deficits in autism are discussed.
