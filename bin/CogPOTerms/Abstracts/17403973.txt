Processing affective facial expressions is an important component of interpersonal
relationships. However, depressed patients show impairments in this system. The present
study investigated the neural correlates of implicit processing of happy facial expressions
in depression and identified regions affected by antidepressant therapy.Two groups
of subjects participated in a prospective study with functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). The patients were 19 medication-free subjects (mean age, 43.2 years)
with major depression, acute depressive episode, unipolar subtype. The comparison
group contained 19 matched healthy volunteers (mean age, 42.8 years). Both groups
underwent fMRI scans at baseline (week 0) and at 8 weeks. Following the baseline scan,
the patients received treatment with fluoxetine, 20 mg daily. The fMRI task was implicit
affect recognition with standard facial stimuli morphed to display varying intensities
of happiness. The fMRI data were analyzed to estimate the average activation (overall
capacity) and differential response to variable intensity (dynamic range) in brain
systems involved in processing facial affect.An attenuated dynamic range of response
in limbic-subcortical and extrastriate visual regions was evident in the depressed
patients, relative to the comparison subjects. The attenuated extrastriate cortical
activation at baseline was increased following antidepressant treatment, and symptomatic
improvement was associated with greater overall capacity in the hippocampal and extrastriate
regions.Impairments in the neural processing of happy facial expressions in depression
were evident in the core regions of affective facial processing, which were reversed
following treatment. These data complement the neural effects observed with negative
affective stimuli.
