Although depressed mood is a normal occurrence in response to adversity in all individuals,
what distinguishes those who are vulnerable to major depressive disorder (MDD) is
their inability to effectively regulate negative mood when it arises. Investigating
the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such
processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology
of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study
demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating
negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed
bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task,
nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left
ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC).
No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive
association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed
patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by
accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed
individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature
underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement
of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial
prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative
stimuli.
