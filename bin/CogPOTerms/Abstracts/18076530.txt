Previous studies have indicated abnormalities in response flexibility in pediatric
bipolar disorder (BD). Dysfunction in response flexibility may contribute to the pattern
of behavioral and emotional dysregulation that is characteristic of BD, since depressed
and manic patients respond inflexibly to emotional stimuli (i.e., anhedonia in the
case of depression or inappropriate positive affect in the case of mania). The present
study was undertaken to determine if neuronal responses differed between BD and control
subjects on a simple motor response flexibility task.To elucidate the neural substrates
mediating response flexibility in pediatric BD, we studied 25 youth with BD and 17
age-, gender- and IQ-matched controls (CON) as they performed the change task while
undergoing event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The change
task is a new fMRI task that requires subjects to both inhibit and replace a prepotent
motor response with another motor response after the initial response has been cued.On
correctly performed change trials relative to correctly performed go trials, BD patients
generated significantly more activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
and in the primary motor cortex than did healthy controls, even though performance
levels did not differ across groups.These results indicate that functional deficits
within the left DLPFC may mediate deficits in response flexibility in pediatric BD.
This deficit may extend beyond the realm of motor control and also affect emotion
regulation.
