Previous small-sample studies have shown altered frontotemporal activity in schizophrenia
patients with auditory hallucinations and impaired monitoring of self-generated speech.
We examined a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia (n = 63) and a representative
group of healthy controls (n = 20) to disentangle performance, illness, and symptom-related
effects in functional magnetic resonance imaging-detected brain abnormalities during
monitoring of self- and externally generated speech in schizophrenia. Our results
revealed activation of the thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus, MGN) and frontotemporal
regions with accurate monitoring across all participants. Less activation of the thalamus
(MGN, pulvinar) and superior-middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri occurred in
poorly performing patients (1 standard deviation below controls' mean; n = 36), relative
to the combined group of controls and well-performing patients. In patients, (1) greater
deactivation of the ventral striatum and hypothalamus to own voice, combined with
nonsignificant activation of the same regions to others' voice, associated positively
with negative symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive
social avoidance) regardless of performance and (2) exaggerated activation of the
right superior-middle temporal gyrus during undistorted, relative to distorted, feedback
associated with both positive symptoms (hallucinations, persecution) and poor performance.
A further thalamic abnormality characterized schizophrenia patients regardless of
performance and symptoms. We conclude that hypoactivation of a neural network comprised
of the thalamus and frontotemporal regions underlies impaired speech monitoring in
schizophrenia. Positive symptoms and poor monitoring share a common activation abnormality
in the right superior temporal gyrus during processing of degraded speech. Altered
striatal and hypothalamic modulation to own and others' voice characterizes emotionally
withdrawn and socially avoidant patients.
