People vulnerable to depression are at increased risk of relapse if they live in highly
critical family environments. To explore this link, we used neuroimaging methods to
examine cortico-limbic responding to personal criticisms in healthy participants and
participants with known vulnerability to major depression. Healthy controls and fully
recovered participants with a past history of major depression were scanned while
they heard praising, critical, and neutral comments from their own mothers. Prior
to scanning, the formerly depressed and the control participants were indistinguishable
with respect to self-reported positive, negative, or anxious mood. They also reported
similar mood changes after being praised or criticized. However, formerly depressed
participants responded to criticism with greater activation in the amygdala and less
activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) than did controls. During praise and neutral commentary, amygdala activation
was comparable in both groups, although lower levels of activation in the DLPFC and
ACC still characterized formerly depressed participants. Vulnerability to depression
may be associated with abnormalities in cortico-limbic activation that are independent
of mood state and that remain even after full recovery. Criticism may be a risk factor
for relapse because it activates the amygdala and perturbs the affective circuitry
that underlies depression.
