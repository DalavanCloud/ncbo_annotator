Dysfunctions in prefrontal cortical networks are thought to underlie working memory
(WM) impairments consistently observed in both subjects with bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia. It remains unclear, however, whether patterns of WM-related hemodynamic
responses are similar in bipolar and schizophrenia subjects compared to controls.
We used fMRI to investigate differences in blood oxygen level dependent activation
during a WM task in 21 patients with euthymic bipolar I, 20 patients with schizophrenia,
and 38 healthy controls. Subjects were presented with four stimuli (abstract designs)
followed by a fifth stimulus and required to recall whether the last stimulus was
among the four presented previously. Task-related brain activity was compared within
and across groups. All groups activated prefrontal cortex (PFC), primary and supplementary
motor cortex, and visual cortex during the WM task. There were no significant differences
in PFC activation between controls and euthymic bipolar subjects, but controls exhibited
significantly increased activation (cluster-corrected P &lt; 0.05) compared to patients
with schizophrenia in prefrontal regions including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC). Although the bipolar group exhibited intermediate percent signal change in
a functionally defined DLPFC region of interest with respect to the schizophrenia
and control groups, effects remained significant only between patients with schizophrenia
and controls. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may share some behavioral, diagnostic,
and genetic features. Differences in the patterns of WM-related brain activity across
groups, however, suggest some diagnostic specificity. Both patient groups showed some
regional task-related hypoactivation compared to controls across the brain. Within
DLPFC specifically, patients with schizophrenia exhibited more severe WM-related dysfunction
than bipolar subjects.2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
