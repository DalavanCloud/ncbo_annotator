Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques were used to identify the
neural circuitry underlying emotional processing in control and depressed subjects.
Depressed subjects were studied before and after treatment with venlafaxine. This
new technique provides a method to noninvasively image regional brain function with
unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.Echo-planar imaging was used to acquire
whole brain images while subjects viewed positively and negatively valenced visual
stimuli. Two control subjects and two depressed subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for
major depression were scanned at baseline and 2 weeks later. Depressed subjects were
treated with venlafaxine after the baseline scan.Preliminary results from this ongoing
study revealed three interesting trends in the data. Both depressed patients demonstrated
considerable symptomatic improvement at the time of the second scan. Across control
and depressed subjects, the negative compared with the positive pictures elicited
greater global activation. In both groups, activation induced by the negative pictures
decreased from the baseline scan to the 2-week scan. This decrease in activation was
also present in the control subjects when they were exposed to the positive pictures.
In contrast, when the depressed subjects were presented with the positive pictures
they showed no activation at baseline, whereas after 2 weeks of treatment an area
of activation emerged in right secondary visual cortex.While preliminary, these results
demonstrate the power of using fMRI to study emotional processes in normal and depressed
subjects and to examine mechanisms of action of antidepressant drugs.
