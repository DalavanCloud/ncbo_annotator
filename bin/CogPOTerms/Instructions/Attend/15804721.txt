Impaired processing of facial information is one of the broad ranges of cognitive
deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia. This study aimed to elucidate the differences
in brain activities involved in the process of facial working memory (images of neutral
faces as mnemonic content) between schizophrenic patients and healthy comparison subjects
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Group comparison analysis revealed
aberrant activities from the patient group in several cortical areas, including the
left fusiform gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyri/insula,
and left middle temporal gyrus. A decreased level of activity in the left fusiform
gyrus, along with performance reduction, implicates abnormal processing of facial
information in schizophrenia.
