Associations between a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene and
amygdala activation have been found in healthy, depressed, and anxious adults. This
study explored these gene-brain associations in adolescents by examining predictive
effects of serotonin transporter gene variants (S and L(G) allele carriers vs. L(A)
allele homozygotes) and their interaction with diagnosis (healthy vs. patients) on
amygdala responses to emotional faces.Functional magnetic resonance data were collected
from 33 healthy adolescents (mean age: 13.71, 55% female) and 31 medication-free adolescents
with current anxiety or depressive disorders (or both; mean age: 13.58, 56% female)
while viewing fearful, angry, happy, and neutral facial expressions under varying
attention states.A significant three-way genotype-by-diagnosis-by-face-emotion interaction
characterized right amygdala activity while subjects monitored internal fear levels.
This interaction was decomposed to map differential gene-brain associations in healthy
and affected adolescents. First, consistent with healthy adult data, healthy adolescents
with at least one copy of the S or L(G) allele showed stronger amygdala responses
to fearful faces than healthy adolescents without these alleles. Second, patients
with two copies of the L(A) allele exhibited greater amygdala responses to fearful
faces relative to patients with S or L(G) alleles. Third, although weaker, genotype
differences on amygdala responses in patients extended to happy faces. All effects
were restricted to the fear-monitoring attention state.S/L(G) alleles in healthy adolescents,
as in healthy adults, predict enhanced amygdala activation to fearful faces. Contrary
findings of increased activation in patients with L(A)L(A) relative to the S or L(G)
alleles require further exploration.
