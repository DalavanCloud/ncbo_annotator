Bipolar disorder is characterized by disturbed mood homeostasis accompanied by cognitive
impairments that appear to persist during euthymia. Cognitive probes, coupled with
neuroimaging, provide an approach toward clarifying the neurophysiology of bipolar
disorder.Sixteen patients with euthymic bipolar disorder and 16 healthy subjects underwent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a counting Stroop interference
task and a control condition. Task performance was correlated with regional brain
activation differences between groups, and the effect on brain activation of receiving
versus not receiving medications was evaluated.Bipolar patients exhibited impaired
task performance relative to the healthy subjects. In addition, the two groups demonstrated
significantly different patterns of brain activation during the interference task.
Healthy subjects exhibited relatively increased activation in temporal cortical regions,
middle frontal gyrus, putamen, and midline cerebellum. Bipolar subjects exhibited
relatively greater activation in the medial occipital cortex. The groups demonstrated
different associations between task performance and fMRI activation in these brain
regions. No differences in activation in these regions were observed between patients
who were versus those who were not receiving medications; however, patients receiving
medications exhibited greater activation in the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.These differences suggest that patients with euthymic bipolar disorder
fail to activate brain regions associated with performance of an interference task,
which may contribute to impaired task performance. Medications do not explain these
differences but may influence activation of brain regions primarily associated with
performing an interference task.
