The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain
activation in patients with schizophrenia and major depression while they performed
two tasks-a vigilance task and a mental arithmetic task-that differed in cognitive
complexity.In the vigilance task, the participants had to press a response button
whenever a specific number was seen on a screen inside the MR scanner. In the mental
arithmetic task, the participants had to add two consecutive numbers and press the
response button whenever the sum was 10. fMRI was performed with a 1.5-T MR scanner.
Twelve patients with recurrent nonpsychotic unipolar major depression, 12 patients
with schizophrenia, and 12 healthy comparison subjects were included in the study.Performance
data showed that the patients were impaired relative to the comparison subjects and
showed no difference in performance between the patient groups. The patients with
schizophrenia, but not those with major depression, had less activation in prefrontal
brain regions, relative to the comparison participants. However, subtracting brain
activation during the vigilance task from activation during the mental arithmetic
task showed that the schizophrenia patients had activation in parietal areas.A double
dissociation of parietal and frontal lobe activation was found for the schizophrenia
patients and the depression patients. The greater parietal lobe activation in the
patients with schizophrenia may reflect a compensatory strategy for the failure to
recruit cognitive processes that involve frontal lobe areas when solving a mental
arithmetic task.
