Deficits of attention are common among individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and are
related both to genetic liability to the disorder and to functional outcome among
patients. To explore the brain systems underlying these attentional abnormalities,
we compared the response of nine patients with chronic SZ or schizoaffective disorder
to that of 10 matched healthy individuals performing a simple visual vigilance task
during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The two groups performed equivalently
on the task. When the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal during identification
of a target letter among similar-looking letters was compared to the response during
fixation trials, both groups showed multiple clusters of significant brain response
in widespread cortical regions. Compared with healthy participants, SZ patients showed
a diminished response in the inferior frontal cortex and an abnormally enhanced response
in right postcentral gyrus, right medial temporal lobe and left cerebellum. The results
suggest that abnormalities of functional brain response to attentional tasks can be
observed among patients with SZ even when behavioral performance is unimpaired, and
provide further evidence that brain systems related to attention are likely to be
involved in the pathophysiology of the disorder.
