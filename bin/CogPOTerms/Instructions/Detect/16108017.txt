The acquisition of both structural MRI (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) data for a
given study is a very common practice. However, these data are typically examined
in separate analyses, rather than in a combined model. We propose a novel methodology
to perform independent component analysis across image modalities, specifically, gray
matter images and fMRI activation images as well as a joint histogram visualization
technique. Joint independent component analysis (jICA) is used to decompose a matrix
with a given row consisting of an fMRI activation image resulting from auditory oddball
target stimuli and an sMRI gray matter segmentation image, collected from the same
individual. We analyzed data collected on a group of schizophrenia patients and healthy
controls using the jICA approach. Spatially independent joint-components are estimated
and resulting components were further analyzed only if they showed a significant difference
between patients and controls. The main finding was that group differences in bilateral
parietal and frontal as well as posterior temporal regions in gray matter were associated
with bilateral temporal regions activated by the auditory oddball target stimuli.
A finding of less patient gray matter and less hemodynamic activity for target detection
in these bilateral anterior temporal lobe regions was consistent with previous work.
An unexpected corollary to this finding was that, in the regions showing the largest
group differences, gray matter concentrations were larger in patients vs. controls,
suggesting that more gray matter may be related to less functional connectivity in
the auditory oddball fMRI task.Hum Brain Mapp, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
