Inhibitory control or regulatory difficulties have been explored in major depressive
disorder (MDD) but typically in the context of affectively salient information. Inhibitory
control is addressed specifically by using a task devoid of affectively-laden stimuli,
to disentangle the effects of altered affect and altered inhibitory processes in MDD.Twenty
MDD and 22 control volunteer participants matched by age and gender completed a contextual
inhibitory control task, the Parametric Go/No-go (PGNG) task during functional magnetic
resonance imaging. The PGNG includes three levels of difficulty, a typical continuous
performance task and two progressively more difficult versions including Go/No-go
hit and rejection trials. After this test, 15 of 20 MDD patients completed a full
10-week treatment with s-citalopram.There was a significant interaction among response
time (control subjects better), hits (control subjects better), and rejections (patients
better). The MDD participants had greater activation compared with the control group
in frontal and anterior temporal areas during correct rejections (inhibition). Activation
during successful inhibitory events in bilateral inferior frontal and left amygdala,
insula, and nucleus accumbens and during unsuccessful inhibition (commission errors)
in rostral anterior cingulate predicted post-treatment improvement in depression symptoms.The
imaging findings suggest that in MDD subjects, greater neural activation in frontal,
limbic, and temporal regions during correct rejection of lures is necessary to achieve
behavioral performance equivalent to control subjects. Greater activation in similar
regions was further predictive of better treatment response in MDD.
