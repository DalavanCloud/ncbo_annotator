Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the hypothesis
that schizophrenia is associated with a dysfunction of prefrontal brain regions during
motor response inhibition. Generic brain activation of six male medicated patients
with schizophrenia was compared to that of seven healthy comparison subjects matched
for sex, age, and education level while performing 'stop' and 'go-no-go' tasks. No
group differences were observed in task performance. Patients, however, showed reduced
BOLD signal response in left anterior cingulate during both inhibition tasks and reduced
left rostral dorsolateral prefrontal and increased thalamus and putamen BOLD signal
response during stop task performance. Despite good task performance, patients with
schizophrenia thus showed abnormal neural network patterns of reduced left prefrontal
activation and increased subcortical activation when challenged with motor response
inhibition.
