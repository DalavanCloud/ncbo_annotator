To examine the neural basis of impairments in interpreting facial emotions in children
and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).Twelve children and adolescents
with ASD and 12 typically developing (TD) controls matched faces by emotion and assigned
a label to facial expressions while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.Both
groups engaged similar neural networks during facial emotion processing, including
activity in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and prefrontal cortex. However, between-group
analyses in regions of interest revealed that when matching facial expressions, the
ASD group showed significantly less activity than the TD group in the FG, but reliably
greater activity in the precuneus. During the labeling of facial emotions, no between-group
differences were observed at the behavioral or neural level. Furthermore, activity
in the amygdala was moderated by task demands in the TD group but not in the ASD group.These
findings suggest that children and adolescents with ASD in part recruit different
neural networks and rely on different strategies when processing facial emotions.
High-functioning individuals with ASD may be relatively unimpaired in the cognitive
assessment of basic emotions, yet still show differences in the automatic processing
of facial expressions.
