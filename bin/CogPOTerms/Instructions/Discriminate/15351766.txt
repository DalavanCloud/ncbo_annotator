Depression is associated with interpersonal difficulties related to abnormalities
in affective facial processing.To map brain systems activated by sad facial affect
processing in patients with depression and to identify brain functional correlates
of antidepressant treatment and symptomatic response.Two groups underwent scanning
twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an 8-week period.
The event-related fMRI paradigm entailed incidental affect recognition of facial stimuli
morphed to express discriminable intensities of sadness.Participants were recruited
by advertisement from the local population; depressed subjects were treated as outpatients.We
matched 19 medication-free, acutely symptomatic patients satisfying DSM-IV criteria
for unipolar major depressive disorder by age, sex, and IQ with 19 healthy volunteers.
Intervention After the baseline assessment, patients received fluoxetine hydrochloride,
20 mg/d, for 8 weeks.Average activation (capacity) and differential response to variable
affective intensity (dynamic range) were estimated in each fMRI time series. We used
analysis of variance to identify brain regions that demonstrated a main effect of
group (depressed vs healthy subjects) and a group x time interaction (attributable
to antidepressant treatment). Change in brain activation associated with reduction
of depressive symptoms in the patient group was identified by means of regression
analysis. Permutation tests were used for inference.Over time, depressed subjects
showed reduced capacity for activation in the left amygdala, ventral striatum, and
frontoparietal cortex and a negatively correlated increase of dynamic range in the
prefrontal cortex. Symptomatic improvement was associated with reduction of dynamic
range in the pregenual cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and cerebellum.Antidepressant
treatment reduces left limbic, subcortical, and neocortical capacity for activation
in depressed subjects and increases the dynamic range of the left prefrontal cortex.
Changes in anterior cingulate function associated with symptomatic improvement indicate
that fMRI may be a useful surrogate marker of antidepressant treatment response.
