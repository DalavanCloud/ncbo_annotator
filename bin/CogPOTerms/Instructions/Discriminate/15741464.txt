Context processing is a cognitive construct associated with activity in the middle
frontal gyrus. Schizophrenia-related deficits in context processing tasks have been
associated with prefrontal cortical dysfunction. This study evaluated whether prefrontal
cortical dysfunction related to context processing occurred in first-episode, never-medicated
schizophrenia patients, whether this dysfunction also occurred in patients with nonschizophrenia
psychosis, and whether this dysfunction was related to psychotic symptom expression.A
modified version of the AX continuous performance task was conducted during event-related
functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 never-medicated, first-episode schizophrenia
patients, 12 never-medicated patients with first-episode nonschizophrenia psychosis,
and 28 comparison participants without psychiatric disorder.In-scanner measures of
errors and interference reaction time showed that the schizophrenia patients had a
specific deficit in context processing. Trials with greater context processing demands
corresponded to activity in the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann's area 9) in the comparison
subjects and in the patients with nonschizophrenia psychosis, but not in the schizophrenia
patients. Individual differences in prefrontal cortical dysfunction were associated
with context processing measures and disorganization symptoms. The schizophrenia patients
also showed increased activity in the anterior (Brodmann's area 10) and inferior prefrontal
cortices (Brodmann's area 45/46) when they were maintaining context over a delay.Prefrontal
dysfunctions related to context processing were found only in schizophrenia patients
early in the course of the illness, and these dysfunctions were related to disorganization
symptoms. Instead of using context processing during a continuous performance task,
schizophrenia patients may use an inefficient encoding and retrieval strategy.
