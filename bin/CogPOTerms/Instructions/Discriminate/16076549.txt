Using functional MRI, we investigated whether, like healthy subjects, patients with
schizophrenia show a relative hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (PFC) for spatial and shape working memory (WM). We hypothesized that reduced
specialization in schizophrenia would reflect a failure to adopt optimal domain-specific
strategies and would contribute to WM deficits.Twelve healthy subjects and 16 schizophrenia
patients performed spatial and shape WM tasks and a non-WM control task. Direct comparisons
of the spatial and shape WM tasks assessed specialization.Despite deficient WM performance,
both patients and controls showed a relative hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral
PFC for spatial (right) and shape (left) WM and did not differ in this regard.The
finding of intact hemispheric specialization in ventrolateral PFC suggests that patients
employ the same domain-specific strategies as healthy subjects during spatial and
shape WM. Rather than reflecting a failure to adopt the optimal strategy, we hypothesize
that WM deficits in schizophrenia reflect impairments of executive processes that
are required for WM performance regardless of domain. These processes are associated
with activity in the dorsolateral PFC, a region that has been repeatedly implicated
in studies of WM.
