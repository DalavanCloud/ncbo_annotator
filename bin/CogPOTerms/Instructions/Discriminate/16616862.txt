We investigated whether individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) would show
attentional modulation for social (face) and non-social (house) stimuli. Sixteen individuals
with ASD and 16 matched control participants completed a task in which pairs of face
and house stimuli were present on every trial, with one of the pairs randomly assigned
to attended locations and the other to unattended locations. Both mass-univariate
(SPM) and region of interest analyses suggested that responses to houses were modulated
by attention in both groups, but that only the control participants demonstrated attentional
modulation of face-selective regions. Thus, the participants with ASD demonstrated
a lack of attentional modulation which was particularly evident for the social stimulus.
Analyses of effective connectivity indicated that these results were due to a failure
of attention to modulate connectivity between extrastriate areas and V1. We discuss
how these results may suggest a mechanism to explain the reduced salience of social
stimuli in ASD.
