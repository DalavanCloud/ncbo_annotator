Working memory dysfunction is a prominent impairment in patients with schizophrenia.
Our aim was to determine cerebral dysfunctions by means of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) in a large sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients during a
working memory task. 75 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 81 control subjects,
recruited within a multi-center study, performed 2- and 0-back tasks while brain activation
was measured with fMRI. In order to guarantee comparability between data quality from
different scanners, we developed and adopted a standardized, fully automated quality
assurance of scanner hard- and software as well as a measure for in vivo data quality.
After these quality-control measures had been implemented, 48 patients and 57 controls
were included in the final analysis. During attention-related processes, even when
the performance between patients and controls was comparable, there was a recognizable
emergence of cerebral dysfunctions with hypoactivations in the ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (VLPFC), in the superior temporal cortex and in the thalamus. During working
memory performance, parietal hypoactivations, especially in the precuneus, were prominent
and were accompanied by poorer performance in patients. A hyperfrontality emerged
in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Hence, results point to a dysfunctional ventrolateral
prefrontal-parietal network during working memory in patients, suggesting impairments
in basic functions such as retrieval, storage and maintenance. The brain activation
pattern of this large and significant sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients
indicates an imbalanced system failing to adjust the amount of brain activity required
in the cerebral network involved in attention and working memory.
