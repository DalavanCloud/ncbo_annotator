Impairments in the neural circuitry of verbal working memory are evident in depression.
Factors of task demand and depressive state might have significant effects on its
functional neuroanatomy.Two groups underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
while performing a verbal working memory task of varying cognitive load (n-back).
The patient group comprised 20 medication-free individuals in an acute episode of
unipolar major depression and the control group comprised 20 healthy individuals.
Scans were acquired at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, and 8. Patients received treatment with
fluoxetine after the baseline scan. Cerebral activations were measured for mean overall
activation as well as the linear and quadratic load-response activity with increasing
task demand (1-, 2-, 3-back).There were no significant differences in performance
accuracy between groups. However, a main effect of group was observed in the load-response
activity in frontal and posterior cortical regions within the verbal working memory
network in which patients showed a greater load-response relative to control subjects.
Group by time effects were revealed in the load-response activity in the caudate and
thalamus. As a marker of treatment response, a lower linear load-response at baseline
in the dorsal anterior cingulate, left middle frontal, and lateral temporal cortices
was associated with an improved clinical outcome.Maintenance of performance accuracy
in patients was accompanied by a significant increase in the load-response activity
in frontal and posterior cortical regions within the verbal working memory network.
These data also provide further support for resilience of activity in the anterior
cingulate as a predictor of treatment response in depression.
