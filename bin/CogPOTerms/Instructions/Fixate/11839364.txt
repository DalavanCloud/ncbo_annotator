Schizophrenia subjects demonstrate difficulties on tasks requiring saccadic inhibition,
despite normal refixation saccade performance. Saccadic inhibition is ostensibly mediated
via prefrontal cortex and associated cortical/subcortical circuitry. The current study
tests hypotheses about the neural substrates of normal and abnormal saccadic performance
among subjects with schizophrenia.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, blood
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) data were recorded while 13 normal and 14 schizophrenia
subjects were engaged in refixation and antisaccade tasks.Schizophrenia subjects did
not demonstrate the increased prefrontal cortex BOLD contrast during antisaccade performance
that was apparent in the normal subjects. Schizophrenia subjects did, however, demonstrate
normal BOLD contrast associated with refixation saccade performance in the frontal
and supplementary eye fields, and posterior parietal cortex.Results from the current
study support hypotheses of dysfunctional prefrontal cortex circuitry among schizophrenia
subjects. Furthermore, this abnormality existed despite normal BOLD contrast observed
during refixation saccade generation in the schizophrenia group.
