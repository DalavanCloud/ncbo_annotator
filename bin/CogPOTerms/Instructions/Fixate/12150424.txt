This study tested the hypothesis that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex deficits contribute
to both working memory and long-term memory disturbances in schizophrenia. It also
examined whether such deficits were more severe for verbal than nonverbal stimuli.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical activation during
performance of verbal and nonverbal versions of a working memory task and both encoding
and recognition tasks in 38 individuals with schizophrenia and 48 healthy controls.
Performance of both working memory and long-term memory tasks revealed disturbed dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex activation in schizophrenia, although medial temporal deficits were
also present. Some evidence was found for more severe cognitive and functional deficits
with verbal than nonverbal stimuli, although these results were mixed.
