Working memory (WM) deficits are well known in schizophrenia and have been associated
with abnormal activation patterns of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during cognitive
performance. The magnitude and particularly the direction of the PFC activation --
i.e., increased (hyperfrontality) or decreased (hypofrontality) -- in schizophrenia,
as well as its pathophysiological implications, remain controversial. Working memory
is supported by a distributed neural network, whose main components are the PFC and
the posterior parietal (PPC) cortices. Monkey studies indicate that, during WM performance,
PFC functional lesions may be compensated by the PPC if task demands center mainly
on anticipating responses, but not if they center on remembering cues. We hypothesized
that a primarily dysfunctional PFC in schizophrenia might show hypofrontality or hyperfrontality
as a result, respectively, of efficient or inefficient PPC compensation, as dictated
by task demands. To test our proposition, we biased the demands of WM tasks toward
anticipating responses or remembering cues and measured its impact on the PFC-PPC
functional balance in a group of schizophrenic patients and one of normal control
subjects.We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure correlates of neuronal
activity in the PFC and PPC of schizophrenic patients and control subjects performing
WM tasks that either demanded information retention or allowed for response anticipation.When
compared to control subjects, schizophrenic patients exhibited decreased PFC activation
and increased PPC activation during anticipatory WM performance, and increased PFC
activation during mnemonic WM performance.In schizophrenia, a PFC dysfunction results
in hypo- or hyperfrontality as a function of whether other alternate areas of a PFC-PPC
network for WM are available and efficacious in supporting specific task demands.
