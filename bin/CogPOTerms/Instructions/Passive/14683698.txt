As a means toward understanding the neural bases of schizophrenic thought disturbance,
we examined brain activation patterns in response to semantically and superficially
encoded words in patients with schizophrenia. Nine male schizophrenic and 9 male control
subjects were tested in a visual levels of processing (LOP) task first outside the
magnet and then during the fMRI scanning procedures (using a different set of words).
During the experiments visual words were presented under two conditions. Under the
deep, semantic encoding condition, subjects made semantic judgments as to whether
the words were abstract or concrete. Under the shallow, nonsemantic encoding condition,
subjects made perceptual judgments of the font size (uppercase/lowercase) of the presented
words. After performance of the behavioral task, a recognition test was used to assess
the depth of processing effect, defined as better performance for semantically encoded
words than for perceptually encoded words. For the scanned version only, the words
for both conditions were repeated in order to assess repetition-priming effects. Reaction
times were assessed in both testing scenarios. Both groups showed the expected depth
of processing effect for recognition, and control subjects showed the expected increased
activation of the left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC) under semantic encoding relative
to perceptual encoding conditions as well as repetition priming for semantic conditions
only. In contrast, schizophrenics showed similar patterns of fMRI activation regardless
of condition. Most striking in relation to controls, patients showed decreased LIFC
activation concurrent with increased left superior temporal gyrus activation for semantic
encoding versus shallow encoding. Furthermore, schizophrenia subjects did not show
the repetition priming effect, either behaviorally or as a decrease in LIPC activity.
In patients with schizophrenia, LIFC underactivation and left superior temporal gyrus
overactivation for semantically encoded words may reflect a disease-related disruption
of a distributed frontal temporal network that is engaged in the representation and
processing of meaning of words, text, and discourse and which may underlie schizophrenic
thought disturbance.
