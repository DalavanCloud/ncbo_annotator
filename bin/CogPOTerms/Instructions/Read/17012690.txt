Most of the functional neuroimaging studies of depression have focused primarily on
the resting state or responses to negatively valenced stimuli. However, depression
consists not only of an accentuation of negative affective processing but of an inability
to experience pleasure or positive motivation. The authors tested the hypothesis that
depressed subjects would show less activation than healthy comparison subjects, in
response to positive stimuli, in ventral striatal regions associated with processing
of reward and positive stimuli.Positive, negative, and neutral words were presented
to 10 unmedicated depressed patients and 12 healthy comparison subjects in the context
of a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) paradigm. Image processing and
analysis were performed using statistical parametric mapping with a mixed-effects
model. Significant differences in neural responses were assessed, examining group,
condition, and interaction effects of interest within the context of a general linear
model.Relative to comparison subjects, depressed patients demonstrated significantly
less bilateral ventral striatal activation to positive stimuli, correlating with decreased
interest/pleasure in and performance of activities. They also displayed decreased
activation to positive stimuli in a dorsomedial frontal region associated with processing
of self-related stimuli. Responses of depressed subjects to negative stimuli were
consistent with the growing literature on frontolimbic dysfunction in depression.This
finding 1) supports a pathophysiological model of depression that includes reward/motivational
pathway dysfunction, 2) suggests a contributing neural substrate of the inability
to experience pleasure or engage in rewarding activities, 3) provides greater specification
of abnormalities of basal ganglia function in depression, and 4) may help guide treatment
approaches.
