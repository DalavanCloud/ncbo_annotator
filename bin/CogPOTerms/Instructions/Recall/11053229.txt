Evidence implicates subtle neuronal pathology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia,
but how this pathology is reflected in physiological neuroimaging experiments remains
controversial. We investigated PFC function in schizophrenia using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and a parametric version of the n-back working memory (WM)
task. In a group of patients who performed relatively well on this task, there were
three fundamental deviations from the 'healthy' pattern of PFC fMRI activation to
varying WM difficulty. The first characteristic was a greater magnitude of PFC fMRI
activation in the context of slightly impaired WM performance (i.e. physiological
inefficiency). The second was that the significant correlations between behavioral
WM performance and dorsal PFC fMRI activation were in opposite directions in the two
groups. Third, the magnitude of the abnormal dorsal PFC fMRI response was predicted
by an assay of N-acetylaspartate concentrations (NAA) in dorsal PFC, a measure of
neuronal pathology obtained using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Patients
had significantly lower dorsal PFC NAA than controls and dorsal PFC NAA inversely
predicted the fMRI response in dorsal PFC (areas 9, 46) to varying WM difficulty -
supporting the assumption that abnormal PFC responses arose from abnormal PFC neurons.
These data suggest that under certain conditions the physiological ramifications of
dorsal PFC neuronal pathology in schizophrenia includes exaggerated and inefficient
cortical activity, especially of dorsal PFC.
