Brain morphology and physiological measures in schizophrenia have yielded inconsistent
results. This may be due in part to difficulties in ascertaining precisely to what
degree each measure deviates from its genetically and environmentally determined potential
level. We attempted to surmount this problem in a paradigm involving monozygotic twin
pair discordant for schizophrenia. In this paradigm, the difference score and reaction
time between the unaffected member and affected member of a twin pair should represent
the degree of pathologic involvement irrespective of actual level.We investigated,
using fMRI, the neural substrate underlying encoding and retrieval of aversive and
neutral IAPS pictures.An ANOVA on reaction time (RT) between schizophrenia patient
(J) and normal sister (D) significant difference, (F = 5.2, p &lt; or = .02) for J had
less RT than D. Conversely, the ANOVA for the correct pictures retrieved was insignificant
(F = 1.8, p &lt; or = .2). When the brain activity associated with the encoding and retrieval
of the aversive pictures was subtracted (J-D and D-J) from that associated with the
neutral ones, significant loci of activation were found. During encoding: for J-D
the right fusiform gyrus was significantly activated (p &lt; .0001) and for D-J the orbitofrontal
cortex was significantly activated (p &lt; .05). During retrieval: for J-D the right
anterior cingulate (p &lt; .0001) was activated and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(p &lt; .002). For D-J only the cerebellum showed activation (p &lt; .0001).Results indicated
subtle attenuations in some aspects of memory, thus providing another evidence for
cognitive markers of a genetic component in schizophrenia. New approaches in neuropsychiatry-based
on genetic methodologies should further define the cerebral physiology responsible
for schizophrenia.
