We used an event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approach to
examine the neural basis of the selective associative memory deficit in schizophrenia.Fifteen
people with schizophrenia and 18 controls were scanned during a pair and item memory
encoding and recognition task. During encoding, subjects studied items and pairs of
visual objects. In a subsequent retrieval task, participants performed an item recognition
memory test (old/new decisions) and an associative recognition test (intact/rearranged
decisions). The fMRI analysis of the recognition data was restricted to correct items
only and a random effects model was used.At the behavioral level, both groups performed
equally well on item recognition, whereas people with schizophrenia demonstrated lower
performance on associative recognition relative to the control group. At the brain
level, the comparison between associative and item encoding revealed greater activity
in the control group in the left prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus relative to
the schizophrenia group. During recognition, greater left dorsolateral prefrontal
and right inferior prefrontal activations were observed in the control group relative
to the schizophrenia group.This fMRI study implicates the prefrontal cortex among
other brain regions as the basis for the selective associative memory encoding and
recognition deficit seen in schizophrenia.
