It has been suggested that in healthy persons higher-order cognitive processing engaged
by incremental working memory load hierarchically employs more dorsal than ventral
prefrontal resources in healthy individuals. Given that working memory performance
is impaired in schizophrenia, especially at higher executive loads, the authors investigated
how this prefrontal functional organization might be altered in disease, independent
of performance deficits.Using N-back working memory functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data, the authors studied 15 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy
comparison subjects. Subgroups based on median performance accuracy at 2-back were
analyzed; high performers included eight schizophrenia patients and 14 comparison
subjects, and low performers included seven patients and 12 comparison subjects.High-performing
but not low-performing comparison subjects responded to incremental working memory
executive load with disproportionately greater dorsal but not ventral prefrontal cortex
activation, which also predicted performance accuracy. In the high- and low-performing
patient groups, incremental working memory load caused a disproportionate increase
in ventral but not dorsal prefrontal cortex activation relative to the respective
comparison group, which also correlated with accuracy. Functional connectivity between
the ventral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex was relatively greater
in patients, whereas comparison subjects had greater functional connectivity between
the dorsal prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex.The hierarchical organization
of the prefrontal cortex may be compromised in schizophrenia, resulting in loss of
functional specialization and integration at the dorsal prefrontal cortex and in compensatory
activation from the ventral prefrontal cortex, which may ultimately affect working
memory and executive cognition.
