Working memory as a part of higher-order executive functions is defined by the parallel
storage and processing of information. Recent functional fMRI studies have revealed
a functional, interregional disintegration of a neuronal network connecting cortical,
subcortical and cerebellar regions in schizophrenic patients (SZ). Cognitive impairment
in working memory is a core psychopathological correlate of schizophrenic symptoms.
Atypical neuroleptics such as quetiapine have shown good efficacy in treating positive
and negative symptoms. The presented study evaluated the impact of a neuroleptic steady
state treatment with quetiapine on the altered working memory activation patterns
in schizophrenia.Patients were examined by fMRI at baseline and after 12 weeks of
steady state treatment with quetiapine. Matched healthy controls (HC) underwent baseline
examination. In the scanner, stimuli were presented in a 2-back and 0-back condition
of a working memory (wm) paradigm, whereby a degraded and a non-degraded version were
used each time. Additionally, behavioural responses (reaction time to target stimuli
and error ratio) were measured.At baseline, healthy controls revealed increased activity
in the frontal lobe, especially in regions of the prefrontal cortex. Compared to HC,
SZ showed hypoactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) bilaterally for the 2-back condition. In the
2-back degraded condition there was a hypoactivation in both, the right DLPFC and
the VLPFC. Additionally, patients showed bilaterally decreased activation in the basalganglia
in the 2-back and in the right caudatus in the 2-back degraded condition compared
to healthy controls. After treatment with quetiapine, patients activations patterns
were increased. The pre-post comparison of the 2-back condition revealed a significant
increase of activation in the left VLPFC at a significance level of 0.001 (uncorrected).
The 2-back degraded condition led to a significant activation pattern in the lingual
gyrus and the right precuneus. In both wm conditions, at baseline there were no differences
in reaction time but only a worse performance in SZ. After treatment, behavioural
measurement of responses, including reaction time and performance, showed slight improvements
in SZ, although these did not reach statistical significance.The neuronal networks
underlying working memory are clearly altered in schizophrenia. After 12 weeks of
treatment with quetiapine monotherapy, patients showed significant clinical improvement
and revealed increased BOLD activity in the VLPFC during a working memory task, although
there was no improvement of cognitive performance.
