Verbal working memory and emotional self-regulation are impaired in Bipolar Disorder
(BD). Our aim was to investigate the effect of Lamotrigine (LTG), which is effective
in the clinical management of BD, on the neural circuits subserving working memory
and emotional processing. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data from 12 stable
BD patients was used to detect LTG-induced changes as the differences in brain activity
between drug-free and post-LTG monotherapy conditions during a verbal working memory
(N-back sequential letter task) and an angry facial affect recognition task. For both
tasks, LGT monotherapy compared to baseline was associated with increased activation
mostly within the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus, in regions normally engaged
in verbal working memory and emotional processing. Therefore, LTG monotherapy in BD
patients may enhance cortical function within neural circuits involved in memory and
emotional self-regulation.
