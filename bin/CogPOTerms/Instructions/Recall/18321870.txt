Patients who suffer from the devastating psychiatric illness schizophrenia are plagued
by hallucinations, bizarre behavior, and delusional ideas, such as believing that
they are controlled by malevolent outside forces. A fundamental human cognitive operation
that may contribute to these hallmark symptoms is the ability to maintain accurate
and coherent self-referential processing over time, such as occurs during reality
monitoring (distinguishing self-generated from externally perceived information).
However, the neural bases for a disturbance in this operation in schizophrenia have
not been fully explored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we asked clinically
stable schizophrenia patients to remember whether or not they had generated a target
word during an earlier sentence completion task. We found that, during accurate performance
of this self-referential source memory task, the schizophrenia subjects manifest a
deficit in rostral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity--a brain region critically
implicated in both the instantiation and the retrieval of self-referential information
in healthy subjects. Impairment in rostral mPFC function likely plays a key role in
the profound subjective disturbances that characterize schizophrenia and that are
the aspect of the disorder most troubling to patients and to society at large.
