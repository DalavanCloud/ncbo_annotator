People with prodromal symptoms have a very high risk of developing psychosis.To use
functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neurocognitive basis of this
vulnerability.Cross-sectional comparison of regional activation in individuals with
an'at-risk mental state' (at-risk group: n=17), patients with first-episode schizophreniform
psychosis (psychosis group: n=10) and healthy volunteers (controls: n=15) during an
overt verbal fluency task and an N-back working memory task.A similar pattern of between-group
differences in activation was evident across both tasks. Activation in the at-risk
group was intermediate relative to that in controls and the psychosis group in the
inferior frontal and anterior cingulate cortex during the verbal fluency task and
in the inferior frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortex during the N-back
task.The at-risk mental state is associated with abnormalities of regional brain function
that are qualitatively similar to, but less severe than, those in patients who have
recently presented with psychosis.
