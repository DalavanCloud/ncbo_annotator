First-degree relatives of persons with bipolar disorders (BDs) carry elevated risk
for the illness, and manifest deficits in attention and memory (possible "endophenotypes").
However, there is only one published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
study of candidate endophenotypes in BD. We used fMRI to examine brain function in
BD and in first-degree relatives performing a 2-back working memory (WM) task, and
correlated brain activity with mood measures taken at the scanning session. Subjects
(age 32-46) were 19 persons with BD, 18 unmedicated, non-psychotic first-degree relatives
(RELs) of persons with BD, and 19 matched controls, ascertained from a long-term follow-up
of a prenatal cohort study in New England. fMRI signal during 2-back and 0-back WM
tasks was measured on a Siemens 1.5T MR scanner. fMRI data were analyzed using SPM-2.
Persons with BD and RELs failed to suppress activation in the left anterior insula
(BA 13) during WM, whereas controls suppressed activation. Compared to controls, RELs
also failed to suppress activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and superior
parietal cortex. Controls and RELs exhibited greater activation than BD individuals
in the left frontopolar cortex (BA 10) during WM. Results remained significant after
controlling for confounders except for mild attenuation of OFC findings. Significant
correlations between brain activity, mood, and WM suggest that activity in WM circuits
is affected by activity in emotion-regulatory circuits. Persons with BD and RELs exhibit
altered activity in the frontopolar cortex and insula, which may represent biomarkers
of genetic risk for BD.(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
