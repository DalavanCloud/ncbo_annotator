Working memory dysfunction is considered to be fundamental to the cognitive and clinical
features evident in schizophrenia. Functional neuroimaging studies have begun to elucidate
the neurobiological basis of such deficits, however, interpretation of these studies
may be confounded by performance impairment, when the cognitive load exceeds the limited
response capacity of patients with schizophrenia. In this study, patients were pre-selected
on the basis of intact performance on a relatively low-load verbal working memory
task, in order to mitigate against performance confounds. Subjects included 20 right-handed
male subjects with chronic schizophrenia, and 20 right-handed, age-matched, male healthy
controls, without personal or familial psychiatric history. All subjects underwent
fMRI scanning whilst performing a verbal n-back task. There were no significant between-group
differences in target identification; the patient group showed a significantly increased
mean response latency. Both groups demonstrated robust fronto-parietal activation.
In the control subjects, the power of functional response was positively correlated
with reaction time in bilateral posterior parietal cortex, however, this coupling
of behavioural performance and cerebral response was not evident in the patients.
This deficit, apparent within the performance capacity of the patients, may represent
a fundamental abnormality in schizophrenia, and may compromise performance at higher
cognitive loads.
