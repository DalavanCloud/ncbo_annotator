The present fMRI study aimed to investigate effective connectivity within a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar
information processing network in drug free schizophrenic patients while performing
a 2-back working memory task. The finding of enhanced thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical
intrahemispheric connectivity could be interpreted as a compensatory increase of neuronal
connection strength consistent with a model of cortical inefficiency in schizophrenic
patients. Additionally, the result could be integrated into a model of deficient thalamo-cortical
filter functions. Conversely, lower interhemispheric connectivity of the frontal and
parietal association cortex appears to be the functional correlate of reduced cognitive
performance in schizophrenic patients. The study demonstrated the feasibility to model
information processing within cognitive networks and provided additional evidence
for the concept of cognitive dysmetria in schizophrenia.
