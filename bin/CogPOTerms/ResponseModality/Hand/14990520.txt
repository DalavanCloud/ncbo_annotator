Evidence suggests a reversal of the normal left-lateralised response to speech in
schizophrenia.To test the brain's response to emotional prosody in schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder.BOLD contrast functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects while
they passively listened or attended to sentences that differed in emotional prosody.Patients
with schizophrenia exhibited normal right-lateralisation of the passive response to
'pure' emotional prosody and relative left-lateralisation of the response to unfiltered
emotional prosody. When attending to emotional prosody, patients with schizophrenia
activated the left insula more than healthy controls. When listening passively, patients
with bipolar disorder demonstrated less activation of the bilateral superior temporal
gyri in response to pure emotional prosody, and greater activation of the left superior
temporal gyrus in response to unfiltered emotional prosody. In both passive experiments,
the patient groups activated different lateral temporal lobe regions.Patients with
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may display some left-lateralisation of the normal
right-lateralised temporal lobe response to emotional prosody.
