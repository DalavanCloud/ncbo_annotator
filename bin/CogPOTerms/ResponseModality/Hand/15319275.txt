Past functional MRI (FMRI) studies of autism have reported reduced activation in response
to the faces of strangers primarily in the 'fusiform face area' (FFA). An alternative
and potentially stronger test of FFA function in autism is one that attempts to affect
levels of FFA activity using factors believed to modulate function in this brain region,
such as face familiarity and the perception of face identity. The current study presented
personally meaningful faces, such as mother and co-worker, as well as stranger faces
in a rapid event-related FMRI design. Seven autistic and nine normal control adults
participated and pressed a button in response to all female faces. A deconvolution
analysis revealed significant FFA activity in response to familiar and stranger faces
in both autism and normal control groups. Individuals with autism also showed greater
fusiform activity in response to familiar faces than stranger faces, as well as the
prototypical right hemisphere dominance in response to both types of faces. Normal
subjects showed additional activation to familiar faces in the posterior cingulate,
amygdala and medial frontal lobes, including the anterior cingulate. Subjects with
autism showed a similar, but more limited, network in response to familiar faces.
This network included the amygdala and implies that this structure, involved in multiple
socio-emotional functions, can be responsive in autism in the presence of stimuli
that represent high reward value, such as mother's face. Furthermore, the presence
of a distinct network to process familiar faces in autism, one that included limbic
structures and was not found in response to the faces of strangers, suggests socio-emotional
processing in autism. A potentially noteworthy trend, however, was evidence for a
reduction in medial frontal lobe function in the autism group. The main finding of
FFA activity in autism stands in contrast to most past FMRI studies of face processing
in this disorder. This positive result may reflect the use of personally significant
faces that enhanced attention and motivation in the autistic participants. Furthermore,
given the proposed role of the FFA in establishing person identity, the use of almost
a dozen different personally familiar faces for each participant (totalling 32 non-repeating
faces) may have additionally maximized FFA involvement. Therefore, dysfunction in
the FFA found in other studies of autism may reflect defects in systems that modulate
the FFA, rather than the FFA itself.
