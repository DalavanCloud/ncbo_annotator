A number of functional brain abnormalities have been reported in schizophrenia, but
it remains to be determined which of them represent trait and state markers of the
illness.To delineate regional brain dysfunctions that remain stable and those that
fluctuate during the course of schizophrenia.A cohort of patients with first-episode
schizophrenia and a matched group of control participants underwent functional magnetic
resonance imaging on two occasions 6-8 weeks apart during performance of a working
memory task. The patients' disease was in partial remission at the second scan.Relative
to control participants, the function of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
left thalamus and right cerebellum remained disturbed in the people with schizophrenia,
whereas the dysfunction of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right thalamus,
left cerebellum and cingulate gyrus normalised, with significant reduction in symptoms.These
results suggest that dysfunction of the left fronto-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry is
a relatively stable characteristic of schizophrenia, whereas disturbance of the right
circuitry and cingulate gyrusis predominantly a state-related phenomenon.
