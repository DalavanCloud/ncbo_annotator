Several lines of evidence suggest that deficits in cognition persist in bipolar patients
during periods of euthymia. Working memory impairment has been observed in euthymic
bipolar patients and noted to be a significant source of functional deficits in psychiatric
disorders. Functional changes associated with these cognitive deficits however, remain
poorly understood. We hypothesized that patients with bipolar disorder would demonstrate
changes in neuronal activation in specific regions forming part of the working memory
network.Fifteen euthymic bipolar patients and fifteen age- and gender-matched healthy
controls were recruited. Subjects participated in fMRI scans during which a two-back
working memory task alternated with a zero-back control/attention task using a block-design
paradigm. Groups were analyzed separately, and intergroup comparisons were made using
an exploratory, voxel-by-voxel analysis.Bipolar patients performed more poorly on
the cognitive tasks than did healthy controls (F = 3.77, p = 0.04). After covarying
for task performance and reaction time, bipolar patients demonstrated significantly
greater activation than healthy subjects in several regions including the fronto-polar
prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and posterior parietal
cortex. No areas showed a significant decrease in activation, compared with healthy
controls.Our findings suggest that decreased working memory performance in bipolar
patients reflects specific neurofunctional deficits. These deficits may represent
primary areas of neuropathology or be secondary to neuropathology elsewhere in the
working memory network. Continued research utilizing other imaging modalities may
further clarify the underlying neuropathology involved in these cognitive deficits.Blackwell
