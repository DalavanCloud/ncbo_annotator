In a recent longitudinal study of first-episode schizophrenia patients, we found that
while dysfunction of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right thalamus,
left cerebellum and cingulate gyrus normalized with antipsychotic treatment and significant
reduction in symptomatology, the left DLPFC, left thalamus, and right cerebellum remained
disturbed. In the present study we investigated whether these abnormalities are also
present in clinically stable, relatively well-functioning schizophrenia patients in
comparison to control subjects during performance of the N-back working-memory task.Twelve
schizophrenia and 12 control subjects completed the study. The functional images collected
during scanning were analyzed using a random-effects model in a restricted set of
six regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, the exploratory search in the entire
brain volume was performed.The ROI analyses revealed relative underactivation in the
region of the left DLPFC and the right cerebellum, as well as overactivation in the
left cerebellum. The exploratory whole-brain search exposed additional overactivation
in the medial frontal, anterior cingulate, and left parietal cortices.The present
study provides evidence of significant underactivations in stable schizophrenia patients
in regions that we have previously observed to be dysfunctional in acutely psychotic
and partially remitted patients, together with extensive overactivations in several
regions that potentially reflect some compensatory mechanism or increased effort on
the working-memory task.
