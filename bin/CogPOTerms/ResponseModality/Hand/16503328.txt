Previous neuroimaging studies of working memory (WM) in schizophrenia, typically focusing
on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, yield conflicting results, possibly because of
varied choice of tasks and analysis techniques. We examined neural function changes
at several WM loads to derive a more complete picture of WM dysfunction in schizophrenia.We
used a version of the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm to test WM function at five
distinct loads. Eighteen schizophrenia patients and 18 matched healthy controls were
scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla.Patterns of both overactivation
and underactivation in patients were observed depending on WM load. Patients' activation
was generally less responsive to load changes than control subjects', and different
patterns of between-group differences were observed for memory encoding and retrieval.
In the specific case of successful retrieval, patients recruited additional neural
circuits unused by control subjects. Behavioral effects were generally consistent
with these imaging results.Differential findings of overactivation and underactivation
may be attributable to patients' decreased ability to focus and allocate neural resources
at task-appropriate levels. Additionally, differences between encoding and retrieval
suggest that WM dysfunction may be manifested differently during the distinct phases
of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval.
