Our goal in the current report was to design a new functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) task to probe the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) in processing of salient symptom-related cues during the simultaneous
performance of an unrelated task in drug-addicted persons. We used a novel fMRI color-word
drug Stroop task in 14 individuals with cocaine use disorders; subjects had to press
for color of drug vs. matched neutral words. Although there were no accuracy or speed
differences between the drug and neutral conditions in the current sample of subjects,
drug words were more negatively valenced than the matched neutral words. Further,
consistent with prior reports in individuals with other psychopathologies using different
Stroop fMRI paradigms, our more classical color-word Stroop design revealed bilateral
activations in the caudal-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (cdACC) and hypoactivations
in the rostro-ventral anterior cingulate cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex (rACC/mOFC).
A trend for larger rACC/mOFC hypoactivations to the drug than neutral words did not
survive whole-brain corrections. Nevertheless, correlation analyses indicated that
(1) the more the cdACC drug-related activation, the more negative the valence attributed
to the drug words (r=-0.86, P&lt;0.0001) but not neutral words; and (2) the more the
rACC/mOFC hypoactivation to drug minus neutral words, the more the errors committed
specifically to the drug minus neutral words (r=0.85, P&lt;0.0001). Taken together, results
suggest that this newly developed drug Stroop fMRI task may be a sensitive biobehavioral
assay of the functions recruited for the regulation of responses to salient symptom-related
stimuli in drug-addicted individuals.
