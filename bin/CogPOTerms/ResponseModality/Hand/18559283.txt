Major depression (MDD) is characterized by altered emotion processing and deficits
in cognitive control. In cognitive interference tasks, patients with MDD have shown
excessive amygdala activity and under-recruitment of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of antidepressant treatment
on anomalous neural activity in cognitive-control and emotion-processing circuitry.Functional
magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on depressed patients (n=23) (both before
and after antidepressant treatment) compared with matched controls (n=18) while they
performed a cognitive task involving attended and unattended fear-related stimuli.After
eight weeks of SSRI antidepressant treatment, patients with depression showed significantly
increased DLPFC activity to unattended fear-related stimuli and no longer differed
from controls in either DLPFC or amygdala activity.These results suggest that antidepressant
treatment increases DLPFC under-activity during cognitive tasks that include emotional
interference.The sample was fairly homogeneous and this may limit generalizability.
