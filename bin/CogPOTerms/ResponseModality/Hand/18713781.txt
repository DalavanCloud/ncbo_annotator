Passivity experiences are hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia that can be characterized
by the belief that one's thoughts or actions are controlled by an external agent.
It has recently been suggested that these psychotic experiences result from defective
monitoring of one's own actions, i.e. disturbed comparison of actions and perceived
outcomes. In this study, we examined the function of the previously characterized
action monitoring network of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), medial (mPFC) and
lateral prefrontal cortices in patients with different levels of passivity symptoms
with an fMRI task. The visuomotor fMRI task demanded control of visually perceived
object movements by alternating button presses with the left and the right index finger.
In the monitoring condition of this task subjects stopped their actions whenever they
detected visuomotor incongruence. fMRI and behavioural data from 15 patients were
tested for correlation with passivity symptoms using standardized Scale for Assessment
of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)- and AMDP- passivity symptom ratings. Both types of data
were tested for differences between the patients group and 15 healthy controls. In
the patient group we found the expected correlation of passivity symptoms and visuomotor
monitoring performance. There was a significant positive correlation of passivity
symptoms with increased latency of incongruence detection and a negative correlation
of SAPS-passivity with the number of detected events. fMRI data revealed correlations
of passivity symptoms with activation in bilateral IPL, primary motor and sensory
cortices in the action monitoring condition. A correlation of passivity symptoms with
the main experimental effect (actions with -- actions without monitoring) was found
in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and in the left IPL. No group differences
or group by task interactions were found within the visuomotor-action-monitoring network.
Our results demonstrate the association between passivity symptoms and the dysfunction
of visuomotor action monitoring and support the idea that psychotic passivity experiences
result from dysfunctions of central action monitoring mechanisms: According to pre-existing
concepts of parietal cortex function, IPL-hyperactivation may represent an increase
in false detections of visuomotor incongruence while the correlation between passivity
and the differential effect of monitoring on PCC-activation assumedly represents greater
self-monitoring effort in passivity experiences.
