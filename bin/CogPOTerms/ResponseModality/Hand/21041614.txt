Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with behavioral and neurophysiological
evidence of mood-congruent processing biases toward explicitly presented, emotionally
valenced stimuli. However, few studies have investigated such biases toward implicitly
presented stimuli.To investigate differential amygdala responses to sad, happy, and
neutral faces presented below the level of explicit conscious awareness using a backward
masking task in unmedicated participants with MDD and healthy controls (HCs).Initial
cross-sectional design followed by a longitudinal treatment trial using functional
magnetic resonance imaging.Psychiatric outpatient clinic at the National Institute
of Mental Health.We studied 22 unmedicated, currently depressed people with MDD (dMDD),
16 unmedicated individuals with MDD in full remission (rMDD), and 25 HCs.Ten dMDD
participants underwent 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment with the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride.Amygdala region-of-interest and whole-brain
analyses evaluated the hemodynamic response during exposure to masked sad vs masked
happy faces, to masked sad vs neutral faces, and to masked happy vs neutral faces.The
dMDD participants showed greater amygdala responses than HCs to masked sad faces,
whereas HCs showed greater amygdala responses to masked happy faces. The bias toward
sad faces also was evident in rMDD participants relative to HCs and did not differ
between dMDD and rMDD participants. This processing bias reversed toward the normative
pattern in dMDD participants after sertraline treatment.Emotional-processing biases
occur in amygdala responses to sad faces presented below the level of conscious awareness
in dMDD or rMDD individuals and to happy faces in HCs. By influencing the salience
of social stimuli, mood-congruent processing biases in the amygdala may contribute
to dysfunction in conscious perceptions and social interactions in MDD. Our data suggest,
however, that the negative bias resolves and a positive bias develops in patients
with MDD during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment.
