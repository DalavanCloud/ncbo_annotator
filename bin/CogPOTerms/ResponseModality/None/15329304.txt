FMRI was used to study cortical activation patterns in nine healthy male subjects
and nine high-functioning male schizophrenia patients during a letter verbal fluency
task. Both groups showed similar patterns of activation, however, in controls the
activation was primarily in the left broca area, while for schizophrenia patients,
it was more bilateral. These data indicate that high-functioning schizophrenia patients
show a reduced language lateralization of the frontal cortex compared to healthy controls.
