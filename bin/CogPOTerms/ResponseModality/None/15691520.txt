Accurate recognition of facial expressions is crucial for social functioning. In depressed
individuals, implicit and explicit attentional biases away from happy and toward sad
stimuli have been demonstrated. These may be associated with the negative cognitions
in these individuals.Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
neural responses to happy and sad facial expressions were measured in 14 healthy individuals
and 16 individuals with major depressive disorder.Healthy but not depressed individuals
demonstrated linear increases in response in bilateral fusiform gyri and right putamen
to expressions of increasing happiness, while depressed individuals demonstrated linear
increases in response in left putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala, and right
fusiform gyrus to expressions of increasing sadness. There was a negative correlation
in depressed individuals between depression severity and magnitude of neural response
within right fusiform gyrus to happy expressions.Our findings indicate preferential
increases in neural response to sad but not happy facial expressions in neural regions
involved in the processing of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals. These findings
may be associated with the above pattern of implicit and explicit attentional biases
in these individuals and suggest a potential neural basis for the negative cognitions
and social dysfunction in major depression.
