An inability to self-regulate negative emotions appears to play a pivotal role in
the genesis of major depressive disorder. This inability may be related to a dysfunction
of the neural circuitry underlying emotional self-regulation. This functional magnetic
resonance imaging study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Depressed individuals
and controls were scanned while they attempted to voluntarily down-regulate sad feelings.
The degree of difficulty experienced during down-regulation of sadness was higher
in depressed individuals. Furthermore, there was greater activation in the right dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior temporal pole, right amygdala, and right
insula in depressed individuals. These results suggest that emotional dysregulation
in major depressive disorder is related to a disturbance in the neural circuitry of
emotional self-regulation.
