A dysfunction in the interaction between executive function and mood regulation has
been proposed as the pathophysiology of depression. However, few studies have investigated
the alteration in brain systems related to executive control over emotional distraction
in depression. To address this issue, 19 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD)
and 20 healthy controls were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Participants performed an emotional oddball task in which infrequently presented circle
targets required detection while sad and neutral pictures were irrelevant novel distractors.
Hemodynamic responses were compared for targets, sad distractors, and for targets
that followed sad or neutral distractors (Target-after-Sad and Target-after-Neutral).
Patients with MDD revealed attenuated activation overall to targets in executive brain
regions. Behaviorally, MDD patients were slower in response to Target-after-Sad than
Target-after-Neutra stimuli. Patients also revealed a reversed activation pattern
from controls in response to this contrast in the left anterior cingulate, insula,
right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and bilateral middle frontal gyrus. Those patients
who engaged the right IFG more during Target-after-Neutral stimuli responded faster
to targets, confirming a role of this region in coping with emotional distraction.
The results provide direct evidence of an alteration in the neural systems that interplay
cognition with mood in MDD.
