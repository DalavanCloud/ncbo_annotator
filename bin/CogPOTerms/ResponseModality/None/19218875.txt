Neuroimaging studies implicate the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) as
a critical brain region in adult depression. However, unlike adult depression, little
is known about the underlying neural substrates of adolescent depression, and there
are no published data examining differences in sgACC activation between depressed
and healthy adolescents. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
examine sgACC activity in 26 depressed and normal 13-17-year olds during the performance
of a stop-signal task. Significantly greater sgACC activation was found in the depressed
adolescents relative to controls. These results establish for the first time abnormal
functioning of the sgACC in depressed adolescents and have important implications
for understanding the underlying neural correlates and potential treatments of adolescent
depression.
