It has been reported that one of the core features in patients with bipolar disorder
II (BD II) is increased impulsivity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
patients with BD II showed decreased activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
(dACC) as compared to healthy controls when performing a task sensitive to impulsivity.Twenty-seven
BD II patients and 28 healthy controls performed a Go/No-go task during a functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. Eleven of the patients were unmedicated,
and possible group differences between medicated and unmedicated patients were also
assessed. Results: The groups did not differ in behavioral performance on the Go/No-go
task. Both BD II subjects and healthy controls demonstrated dACC activity during the
task, and analyses revealed no statistically significant group differences. Medicated
and unmedicated patients also did not differ in the degree of fMRI activation.These
findings do not support the hypothesis of abnormal dACC activity during a Go/No-go
task in BD II patients.
