Neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder (BD) have provided evidence of brain functional
abnormalities during both the states of mania and remission. However, the differences
in brain function between these two states are still poorly known. In the current
study, we aimed to use a longitudinal design to examine the functional changes associated
with symptomatic remission from mania within the brain network underlying motor response
inhibition.Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 10 BD
patients and 10 healthy subjects were imaged twice while performing a Go/NoGo task.
Patients were in a manic state when they underwent the first scan and fully remitted
during the second scan. A mixed-effect ANOVA was used to identify brain regions showing
differences in activation change over time between the two groups.The left amygdala
was the only brain region to show a time-dependent change in activation that was significantly
different between BD patients and healthy subjects. Further analyses revealed that
this difference arose from the patient group, in which amygdala activation was decreased
between mania and subsequent remission.This finding suggests that a decrease in left
amygdala responsiveness is a critical phenomenon associated with remission from mania.
It emphasizes the relevance of longitudinal approaches for identifying neurofunctional
modifications associated with mood changes in BD.
