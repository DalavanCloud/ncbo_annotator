Schizophrenia is characterized by executive functioning deficits, presumably mediated
by prefrontal cortex dysfunction. For example, schizophrenia participants show performance
deficits on ocular motor delayed response (ODR) tasks, which require both inhibition
and spatial working memory for correct performance.The present functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) study compared neural activity of 14 schizophrenia and 14
normal participants while they performed ODR tasks.Schizophrenia participants generated:
1) more trials with anticipatory saccades (saccades made during the delay period),
2) memory saccades with longer latencies, and 3) memory saccades of decreased accuracy.
Increased blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes were observed in
both groups in ocular motor circuitry (e.g., supplementary eye fields [SEF], lateral
frontal eye fields [FEF], inferior parietal lobule [IPL], cuneus, and precuneus).
The normal, but not the schizophrenia, group demonstrated BOLD signal changes in dorsolateral
prefrontal regions (right Brodmann area [BA] 9 and bilateral BA 10), medial FEF, insula,
thalamus, and basal ganglia. Correlations between percentage of anticipatory saccade
trials and BOLD signal changes were more similar between groups for subcortical regions
and less similar for cortical regions.These results suggest that executive functioning
deficits in schizophrenia may be associated with dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
circuitry, evidenced by decreased prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus activity
in the schizophrenia group during ODR task performance.
