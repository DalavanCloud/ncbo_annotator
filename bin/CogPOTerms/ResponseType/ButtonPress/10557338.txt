Antipsychotic drug treatment of schizophrenia may be complicated by side effects of
widespread dopaminergic antagonism, including exacerbation of negative and cognitive
symptoms due to frontal cortical hypodopaminergia. Atypical antipsychotics have been
shown to enhance frontal dopaminergic activity in animal models. We predicted that
substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia
would be associated with enhanced functional activation of frontal cortex. We measured
cerebral blood oxygenation changes during periodic performance of a verbal working
memory task, using functional MRI, on two occasions (baseline and 6 weeks later) in
two cohorts of schizophrenic patients. One cohort (n = 10) was treated with typical
antipsychotic drugs throughout the study. Risperidone was substituted for typical
antipsychotics after baseline assessment in the second cohort (n = 10). A matched
group of healthy volunteers (n = 10) was also studied on a single occasion. A network
comprising bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral premotor cortex, the supplementary
motor area, and posterior parietal cortex was activated by working memory task performance
in both the patients and comparison subjects. A two-way analysis of covariance was
used to estimate the effect of substituting risperidone for typical antipsychotics
on power of functional response in the patient group. Substitution of risperidone
increased functional activation in right prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area,
and posterior parietal cortex at both voxel and regional levels of analysis. This
study provides direct evidence for significantly enhanced frontal function in schizophrenic
patients after substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic drugs, and it
indicates the potential value of functional MRI as a tool for longitudinal assessment
of psychopharmacological effects on cerebral physiology.
