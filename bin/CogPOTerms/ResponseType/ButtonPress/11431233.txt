The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been implicated in both working memory and
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A relationship among dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex activity, working memory dysfunction, and symptoms in schizophrenia has not
been firmly established, partly because of generalized cognitive impairments in patients
and task complexity. Using tasks that parametrically manipulated working memory load,
the authors tested three hypotheses: 1) patients with schizophrenia differ in prefrontal
activity only when behavioral performance differentiates them from healthy comparison
subjects, 2) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction is associated with poorer
task performance, and 3) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction is associated
with cognitive disorganization but not negative or positive symptoms.Seventeen conventionally
medicated patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy comparison subjects underwent
functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing multiple levels of the "n-back"
sequential-letter working memory task.Patients with schizophrenia showed a deficit
in physiological activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's
area 46/9) in the context of normal task-dependent activity in other regions, but
only under the condition that distinguished them from comparison subjects on task
performance. Patients with greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction performed
more poorly. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction was selectively associated
with disorganization symptoms.These results are consistent with the hypotheses that
working memory dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia is caused by a disturbance
of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that this disturbance is selectively associated
with cognitive disorganization. Further, the pattern of behavioral performance suggests
that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction does not reflect a deficit in the
maintenance of stimulus representations per se but points to deficits in more associative
components of working memory.
