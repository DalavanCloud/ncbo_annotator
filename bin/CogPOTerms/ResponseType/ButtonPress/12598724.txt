The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of affect processing
in depressed anhedonic patients and healthy controls. Whole brain functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans were obtained from seven females with a diagnosis of chronic
unipolar major depression and high levels of anhedonia, and seven healthy females,
while they were presented with positive valence and neutral images. Patients, compared
to controls, showed decreased activation in medial frontal cortex, and increased activation
in inferior frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, putamen and insula. Reduced
activation in medial frontal cortex may underlie abnormal positive affect processing
in patients. Increases in neural activation in putamen and thalamus, previously found
in transient sadness, and anterior cingulate could point to an involvement of these
structures in anhedonia.
