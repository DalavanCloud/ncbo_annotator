Nicotine in tobacco smoke can improve functioning in multiple cognitive domains. High
rates of smoking among schizophrenic patients may reflect an effort to remediate cognitive
dysfunction. Our primary aim was to determine whether nicotine improves cognitive
function by facilitating activation of brain regions mediating task performance or
by facilitating functional connectivity.Thirteen smokers with schizophrenia and 13
smokers with no mental illness were withdrawn from tobacco and underwent functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning twice, once after placement of a placebo
patch and once after placement of a nicotine patch. During scanning, subjects performed
an n-back task with two levels of working memory load and of selective attention load.During
the most difficult (dichotic 2-back) task condition, nicotine improved performance
of schizophrenic subjects and worsened performance of control subjects. Nicotine also
enhanced activation of a network of regions, including anterior cingulate cortex and
bilateral thalamus, and modulated thalamocortical functional connectivity to a greater
degree in schizophrenic than in control subjects during dichotic 2-back task performance.In
tasks that tax working memory and selective attention, nicotine may improve performance
in schizophrenia patients by enhancing activation of and functional connectivity between
brain regions that mediate task performance.
