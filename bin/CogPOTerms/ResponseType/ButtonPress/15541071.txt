Even when euthymic bipolar disorder patients can have persistent deficits in working
memory, but the neural basis of this deficit remains unclear. We undertook an functional
magnetic resonance imaging investigation of euthymic bipolar disorder patients performing
two working memory paradigms; the two-back and Sternberg tasks, selected to examine
the central executive and the phonological loop respectively. We hypothesized that
neuronal dysfunction would be specific to the network underlying the executive rather
than the phonological loop component of working memory.Twelve right-handed euthymic
bipolar I males receiving lithium carbonate monotherapy were matched with 12 controls.
The two-back task comprised a single working memory load contrasted with baseline
vigilance condition. The Sternberg paradigm used a parametric design incorporating
variable working memory load with fixed delay between presentation of an array of
items to be remembered and a target item. Functional activation data were acquired
during performance of the tasks and were analysed to produce brain activation maps
representing significant group differences in activation (ANOVA). Load-response curves
were derived from the Sternberg task data set.There were no significant between-group
differences (t-test) in performance of the two-back task, or in 2 x 5 group by memory
load ANOVA for the performance data from Sternberg task. In the two-back task, compared
with controls bipolar disorder patients showed reductions in bilateral frontal, temporal
and parietal activation, and increased activations with the left precentral, right
medial frontal and left supramarginal gyri. No between-group differences were observed
in the Sternberg task at any working memory load.Our findings support the notion that,
in euthymic bipolar disorder, failure to engage fronto-executive function underpins
the core neuropsychological deficits.Blackwell Munksgaard, 2004
