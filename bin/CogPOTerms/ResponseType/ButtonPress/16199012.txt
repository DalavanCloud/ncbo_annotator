The neural basis of formal thought disorder (FTD) is unknown. An influential theory
is that FTD results from impaired semantic memory processing. We explored the neural
correlates of semantic memory retrieval in schizophrenia using an imaging task assessing
semantic object recall.Sixteen healthy control subjects and sixteen schizophrenia
patients whose FTD symptoms were measured with the Thought Disorder Index completed
a verbal object-recall task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants
viewed two words describing object features that either evoked (object recall) or
did not evoke a semantic concept.Schizophrenia patients tended to overrecall objects
for feature pairs that did not describe the same object. Functionally, rostral anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) activation in patients positively correlated with FTD severity
during both correct recalled and overrecalled trials. Compared with control subjects,
during object recalling, patients overactivated bilateral ACC, temporooccipital junctions,
temporal poles and parahippocampi, right inferior frontal gyrus, and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, but underactivated inferior parietal lobules.Our results support
impaired semantic memory retrieval as underlying FTD pathophysiology. Schizophrenia
patients showed abnormal activations of brain areas involved in semantic memory, verbal
working memory, and initiation and suppression of conflicting responses, which were
associated with semantic overrecall and FTD.
