To identify the brain regions associated with emotional processing in euthymic bipolar
patients.The study examined 12 euthymic bipolar patients using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an emotional Stroop (eStroop) task. The
task comprised emotionally valent and neutral words presented in alternating blocks
that was designed to implicitly induce affect. In conjunction with fMRI, galvanic
skin responses (GSR) were measured to monitor arousal.Euthymic bipolar patients had
diminished activation in response to the affective stimuli in both cortical and subcortical
brain regions when compared with healthy subjects. In particular, patients had less
activation in the left ventral prefrontal cortex suggesting a potential trait deficit.
Patients were slower to react than healthy controls, but did not differ with respect
to accuracy.Euthymic bipolar patients are perhaps constrained in their ability to
engage affective processing. Diminished ventral prefrontal cortex activation corroborates
previous reports of a potential trait deficit, suggesting that 'all is not well in
euthymia', although the effects of medication cannot be overlooked.
