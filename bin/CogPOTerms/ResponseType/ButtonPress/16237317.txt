Major depression has been associated with anomalous activation in the subgenual anterior
cingulate cortex, but its response to emotional stimuli is poorly understood. The
primary goal of this study was to compare levels of activation in the subgenual anterior
cingulate cortex of diagnosed depressed and nondepressed participants in response
to happy and sad facial expressions of affect. Whereas cognitive theories of depression
predict increased activation to negative stimuli, depressed participants were found
to exhibit increased activation to both types of stimuli in the subgenual anterior
cingulate cortex. Importantly, the loci were in different regions of the subgenual
anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that there is functional specialization in the
processing of negatively and positively valenced stimuli.
