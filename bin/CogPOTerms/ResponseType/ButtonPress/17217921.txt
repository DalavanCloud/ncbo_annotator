It would be therapeutically useful to predict clinical response to antidepressant
drugs. We evaluated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI
(fMRI) data as predictors of symptom change in people with depression.Brain structure
and function were measured with MRI in 17 patients with major depression immediately
before 8 weeks treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day. For fMRI, patients were scanned
during visual presentation of faces representing different intensities of sadness.
Clinical response was measured by change in serial scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale
for Depression. Symptom change scores (and baseline symptom severity) were regressed
on structural and functional MRI data to map brain regions where grey matter volume,
or activation by sad facial affect processing, was significantly associated with symptom
change (or baseline severity).Faster rates of symptom improvement were strongly associated
with greater grey matter volume in anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and right temporo-parietal
cortex. Patients with greater than median grey matter volume in this system had faster
rates of improvement and significantly lower residual symptom scores after 8 weeks'
treatment. Faster improvement was also predicted by greater functional activation
of anterior cingulate cortex. Baseline symptom severity was negatively correlated
with greater grey matter volume in dorsal prefrontal and anterior midcingulate regions
anatomically distinct from the pregenual and subgenual cingulate regions predicting
treatment response.Structural MRI measurements of anterior cingulate cortex could
provide a useful predictor of antidepressant treatment response.
