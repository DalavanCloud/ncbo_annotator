Although euthymic bipolar patients show minimal manic and depressive symptoms, they
continue to show impaired emotional regulation and cognitive functioning. Few studies
have directly examined the interference of emotional information with cognitive processes
and its underlying cerebral mechanisms in euthymic bipolar patients. The authors examined
the emotional modulation of cognitive processes and its underlying neural mechanisms
in euthymic bipolar patients.Seventeen euthymic bipolar patients and 17 healthy comparison
subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while performing an
emotional and nonemotional go/nogo task. Neural responses associated with the overall
task performance, as well as with the impact of emotional information on the task
performance, were assessed.Bipolar disorder patients exhibited increased activity
in the temporal cortex, specifically to emotional go/nogo conditions, as well as in
the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula, the caudate nuclei, and the dorsal anterior
and posterior cingulate cortices when inhibiting emotional stimuli compared with neutral
stimuli. Conversely, no global attentional deficits were observed on either a behavioral
or neural response level, indicated by similar task performances for all task conditions
and similar brain activation patterns when comparing all the go/nogo conditions with
the resting state.The present study provides evidence of an altered emotional modulation
of cognitive processing in euthymic bipolar patients, indicated by an overactivation
in ventral-limbic, temporal, and dorsal brain structures during emotional go/nogo
conditions in patients relative to comparison subjects.
