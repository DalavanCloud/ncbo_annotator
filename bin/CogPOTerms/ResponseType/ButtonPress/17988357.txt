Neurobiological understanding of bipolar disorder (BD) is limited by a paucity of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research examining correlates of psychological
processes. To begin to address these limitations, the current study tests the hypothesis
that pediatric BD (PBD) subjects exhibit altered neural activation during encoding
of emotional faces compared to typically developing controls.Pediatric BD subjects
(n=23; mean age=14.2+/-3.1 years) and controls (n=22; mean age=14.7+/-2.3 years) were
matched on age, gender, and IQ. In this event-related fMRI study, subjects were scanned
while viewing emotional faces and given a surprise recognition memory test 30 min
postscan. Our main outcome measure was between-group differences in neural activation
during successful versus unsuccessful face encoding.Pediatric BD youth exhibited reduced
memory for emotional faces, relative to healthy comparisons, particularly on fearful
faces. Event-related fMRI analyses controlling for this behavioral difference showed
that PBD subjects, compared to controls, had increased neural activation in the striatum
and anterior cingulate cortex when successfully encoding happy faces and in the orbitofrontal
cortex when successfully encoding angry faces. There were no between-group differences
in neural activation during fearful face encoding.Our results extend what is known
about memory and face emotion processing impairments in PBD subjects by showing increased
fronto-striatal activation during encoding of emotional faces. Further work is required
to determine the impact of mood state, medication, and comorbid illnesses on these
findings.
