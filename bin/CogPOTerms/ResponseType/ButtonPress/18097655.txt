High blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum including the nucleus
accumbens may interfere with reward anticipation and cause secondary negative symptoms
such as apathy or anhedonia. This may not be the case with newer neuroleptics such
as olanzapine, which show less dopamine D2 receptor blockade and a faster off-rate
from the receptor.We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the blood
oxygenation level dependent response in the ventral striatum of schizophrenics medicated
with typical neuroleptics (T1) and after switching them to olanzapine (T2) and of
healthy control subjects at corresponding time points during reward anticipation.Ten
schizophrenics, while medicated with typical neuroleptics (T1) and after having been
switched to olanzapine (T2), and ten matched healthy volunteers participated in a
monetary incentive delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response
to a subsequent target stimulus would either result in monetary gain or have no consequence.During
reward anticipation, healthy volunteers showed significantly higher ventral striatal
activation compared to schizophrenic patients treated with typical neuroleptics but
not olanzapine, which was reflected in a significant interaction between group and
session. In patients treated with typical neuroleptics, but not with olanzapine, decreased
left ventral striatal activation was correlated with negative symptoms.Failure to
activate the ventral striatum during reward anticipation was pharmacologically state-dependent
and observed only in patients treated with typical neuroleptics but not with olanzapine,
which may indicate that this drug did not induce secondary negative symptoms via interference
with reward anticipation.
