Bipolar disorder is associated with dysfunction in prefrontal and limbic areas implicated
in emotional processing.To explore whether lamotrigine monotherapy may exert its action
by improving the function of the neural network involved in emotional processing.We
used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine changes in brain activation
during a sad facial affect recognition task in 12 stable patients with bipolar disorder
when medication-free compared with healthy controls and after 12 weeks of lamotrigine
monotherapy.At baseline, compared with controls, patients with bipolar disorder showed
overactivity in temporal regions and underactivity in the dorsal medial and right
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the dorsal cingulate gyrus. Following lamotrigine
monotherapy, patients demonstrated reduced temporal and increased prefrontal activation.This
preliminary evidence suggests that lamotrigine may enhance the function of the neural
circuitry involved in affect recognition.
