Mania has been frequently associated with impaired inhibitory control. The present
study aimed to identify brain functional abnormalities specifically related to motor
response inhibition in mania by using event-related fMRI in combination with a Go/NoGo
task designed to control for extraneous cognitive processes involved in task performance.
Sixteen manic patients and 16 healthy subjects, group-matched for age and sex, were
imaged while performing a warned equiprobable Go/NoGo task during event-related fMRI.
Between-group differences in brain activation associated with motor response inhibition
were assessed using analyses of covariance. Although no significant between-group
differences in task performance accuracy were observed, patients showed significantly
longer response times on Go trials. After controlling for covariates, the only brain
region that differentiated the two groups during motor response inhibition was the
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), where activation was significantly decreased
in both the right and left hemispheres in manic patients. Our data suggest that response
inhibition in mania is associated with a lack of engagement of the bilateral VLPFC,
which is known to play a primary role in the suppression of irrelevant responses.
This result might give clues to understanding the pathophysiology of disinhibition
and impulsivity that characterize mania.
