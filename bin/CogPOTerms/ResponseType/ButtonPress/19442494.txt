Deficits in inhibitory control have been reported in euthymic bipolar disorder patients.
To date, data on the neuroanatomical correlates of these deficits are exclusively
related to cognitive inhibition. This study aimed to examine the neural substrates
of motor inhibitory control in euthymic bipolar patients. Groups of 20 patients with
euthymic bipolar disorder and 20 demographically matched healthy subjects underwent
event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a Go-NoGo task.
Between-group differences in brain activation associated with motor response inhibition
were assessed by using random-effects analyses. Although euthymic bipolar patients
and healthy subjects performed similarly on the Go-NoGo task, they showed different
patterns of brain activation associated with response inhibition. Specifically, patients
exhibited significantly decreased activation in the left frontopolar cortex and bilateral
dorsal amygdala compared with healthy subjects. There were no brain regions that were
significantly more activated in patients than in healthy subjects. The findings suggest
that euthymic bipolar patients have deficits in their ability to engage the left frontopolar
cortex and bilateral dorsal amygdala during response inhibition. Further research
should ascertain the role that such deficits may play in the emergence of impulsive
behaviors that characterize bipolar disorder.
