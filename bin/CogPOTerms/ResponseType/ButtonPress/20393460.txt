Pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) hyperactivity differentiates treatment
responders from non-responders to various pharmacological antidepressant interventions,
including ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Evidence of pgACC
hyperactivition during non-emotional working memory tasks in patients with major depressive
disorder (MDD) highlights the importance of this region for processing both emotionally
salient and cognitive stimuli. However, it is unclear whether pgACC activity might
serve as a potential biomarker of antidepressant response during working memory tasks
as well, in line with previous research with emotionally arousing tasks. This study
tested the hypothesis that during the N-back task, a widely used working memory paradigm,
low pretreatment pgACC activity, as well as coherence between the pgACC and the amygdala,
would be correlated with the clinical improvement after ketamine. Magnetoencephalography
(MEG) recordings were obtained from 15 drug-free patients with MDD during working
memory performance 1 to 3 days before receiving a single ketamine infusion. Functional
activation patterns were analyzed using advanced MEG source analysis. Source coherence
analyses were conducted to quantify the degree of long-range functional connectivity
between the pgACC and the amygdala. Patients who showed the least engagement of the
pgACC in response to increased working memory load showed the greatest symptomatic
improvement within 4 h of ketamine administration (r=0.82, p=0.0002, false discovery
rate (FDR) &lt;0.05). Pretreatment functional connectivity between the pgACC and the
left amygdala was negatively correlated with antidepressant symptom change (r=-0.73,
p=0.0021, FDR &lt;0.05).These data implicate the pgACC and its putative interaction with
the amygdala in predicting antidepressant response to ketamine in a working memory
task context.
