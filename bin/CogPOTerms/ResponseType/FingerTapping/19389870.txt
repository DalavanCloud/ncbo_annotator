Although motor deficits are common in autism, the neural correlates underlying the
disruption of even basic motor execution are unknown. Motor deficits may be some of
the earliest identifiable signs of abnormal development and increased understanding
of their neural underpinnings may provide insight into autism-associated differences
in parallel systems critical for control of more complex behaviour necessary for social
and communicative development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine
neural activation and connectivity during sequential, appositional finger tapping
in 13 children, ages 8-12 years, with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 13 typically
developing (TD), age- and sex-matched peers. Both groups showed expected primary activations
in cortical and subcortical regions associated with motor execution [contralateral
primary sensorimotor cortex, contralateral thalamus, ipsilateral cerebellum, supplementary
motor area (SMA)]; however, the TD group showed greater activation in the ipsilateral
anterior cerebellum, while the HFA group showed greater activation in the SMA. Although
activation differences were limited to a subset of regions, children with HFA demonstrated
diffusely decreased connectivity across the motor execution network relative to control
children. The between-group dissociation of cerebral and cerebellar motor activation
represents the first neuroimaging data of motor dysfunction in children with autism,
providing insight into potentially abnormal circuits impacting development. Decreased
cerebellar activation in the HFA group may reflect difficulty shifting motor execution
from cortical regions associated with effortful control to regions associated with
habitual execution. Additionally, diffusely decreased connectivity may reflect poor
coordination within the circuit necessary for automating patterned motor behaviour.
The findings might explain impairments in motor development in autism, as well as
abnormal and delayed acquisition of gestures important for socialization and communication.
