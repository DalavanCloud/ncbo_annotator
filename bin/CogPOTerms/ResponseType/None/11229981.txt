The anterior cingulate cortex has been implicated in depression. Results are best
interpreted by considering anatomic and cytoarchitectonic subdivisions. Evidence suggests
depression is characterized by hypoactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate, whereas
hyperactivity in the rostral anterior cingulate is associated with good response to
treatment. The authors tested the hypothesis that activity in the rostral anterior
cingulate during the depressed state has prognostic value for the degree of eventual
response to treatment. Whereas prior studies used hemodynamic imaging, this investigation
used EEG.The authors recorded 28-channel EEG data for 18 unmedicated patients with
major depression and 18 matched comparison subjects. Clinical outcome was assessed
after nortriptyline treatment. Of the 18 depressed patients, 16 were considered responders
4-6 months after initial assessment. A median split was used to classify response,
and the pretreatment EEG data of patients showing better (N=9) and worse (N=9) responses
were analyzed with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, a new method to compute
three-dimensional cortical current density for given EEG frequency bands according
to a Talairach brain atlas.The patients with better responses showed hyperactivity
(higher theta activity) in the rostral anterior cingulate (Brodmann's area 24/32).
Follow-up analyses demonstrated the specificity of this finding, which was not confounded
by age or pretreatment depression severity.These results, based on electrophysiological
imaging, not only support hemodynamic findings implicating activation of the anterior
cingulate as a predictor of response in depression, but they also suggest that differential
activity in the rostral anterior cingulate is associated with gradations of response.
