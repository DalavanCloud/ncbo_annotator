The precise nature of frontal lobe dysfunction in schizophrenia remains unclear. We
have previously demonstrated, using fMRI, a task-specific attenuation of frontal activation
in schizophrenic patients. By using an identical methodology in matched bipolar subjects,
we sought to determine whether this finding is specific to schizophrenia or a correlate
of psychosis in general.Five dextral male bipolar patients and matching groups of
schizophrenic subjects and controls were studied using fMRI. Echoplanar images were
acquired while subjects performed two paced tasks: covert verbal fluency and a semantic
decision task. Generic brain activation maps were constructed from individual images
by sinusoidal regression analysis. Between-group differences in the mean power of
experimental response were identified on a voxel-wise basis by an analysis of variance
(ANOVA).The bipolar patients showed extensive prefrontal activation during verbal
fluency which was significantly greater than in controls. There was no difference
in the prefrontal BOLD response during the semantic decision task.These data indicate
that bipolar patients show a strikingly different pattern of frontal responses compared
to those with schizophrenia and provide further evidence that abnormal frontal activation
in psychotic disorders is more apparent during verbal fluency than semantic decision.
