Patients with mania show a behavioral bias toward positive information in an emotional
go/no go task. This is the converse of the bias toward negative information seen in
unipolar depression that we have recently related to the abnormal function of ventral
and medial prefrontal cortices (PFCs). The aim of this study was to investigate the
neuronal basis of the bias toward positive information in manic patients.During performance
of an emotional go/no go task using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 8 manic
patients and 11 healthy controls were scanned. The task allowed comparison between
neural response to happy, sad, and neutral words in the context of these words being
either targets or distracters.Manic patients showed attenuated orbitofrontal response
when all the semantic conditions were compared with a control condition; however,
they showed an enhanced response of the left ventrolateral PFC to emotional relative
to neutral targets, as well as enhanced ventral and medial prefrontal response to
emotional, particularly happy, distracters. Conclusions: These results suggest a critical
role for ventral and medial dysfunction in the pathology of mania, which might underpin
aspects of cognitive and clinical symptomatology.Copyright 2004 Society of Biological
