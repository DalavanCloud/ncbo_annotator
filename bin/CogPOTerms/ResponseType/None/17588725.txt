The primary aim of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to
test the utility of a paced motor activation task to evaluate frontal-subcortical
(FSC) circuit function in bipolar depression. A secondary aim was to determine if
utilizing both a motor and cognitive activation paradigm (Stroop) would provide information
about the potential role of FSC dysfunction in the cognitive symptoms of bipolar depression.
Analysis of the control group (n=15) alone revealed that the motor task activated
FSC structures. Comparison of the control to bipolar group (n=14) revealed significant
differences between the groups in striatum as well as cortical areas with FSC connections
in response to the non-dominant-hand motor task. In response to the Stroop, there
were significant differences between the groups in portions of the bilateral posterior
cingulate and occipital cortex, but not in FSC structures. While these results must
be considered preliminary, this work supports further studies of paced motor tasks
to probe FSC function. Further, it suggests that the use of both a cognitive and motor
task in the same study provides useful information about brain function. Finally,
it supports the literature implicating FSC circuit abnormalities in bipolar disorder.
