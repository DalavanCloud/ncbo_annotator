Several studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia underactivate brain regions
involved in theory of mind relative to controls during functional brain imaging. However,
in most studies the samples were fairly heterogeneous in terms of clinical symptomatology.
We examined a group of nine patients with first episode or recurrent episodes, who
clinically presented with predominant "passivity" symptoms such as third-person auditory
hallucinations or delusion of control, using a cartoon-based theory of mind task and
compared activation patterns with a group of 13 healthy controls. All patients responded
well to antipsychotic treatment and were only mildly symptomatic at the time of testing.
The patient group showed significantly less activation of the right anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) and right insula compared with controls, but greater activation in dorsal
areas of the medial prefrontal cortex, right temporal areas and left temporo-parietal
junction. Patients with schizophrenia with predominant "passivity" symptoms and good
response to antipsychotic treatment show a markedly diverging pattern of brain activation
during theory of mind task performance compared with healthy controls. These findings
suggest abnormal activation of those brain areas involved in the evaluation of self-reference
during mental state attribution.
