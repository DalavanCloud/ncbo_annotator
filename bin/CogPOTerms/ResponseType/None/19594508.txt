Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have documented abnormalities
in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex in bipolar
disorder in the context of working memory tasks. It is increasingly recognized that
DLPFC regions play a role in mood regulation and the integration of emotion and cognition.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate with fMRI the interaction between
acute sadness and working memory functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder.Nine
depressed individuals with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (BP-I) and 17 healthy control
participants matched for age, gender, education, and IQ completed a 2-back working
memory paradigm under no mood induction, neutral state, or acute sadness conditions
while undergoing fMRI scanning. Functional MRI data were analyzed with SPM2 using
a random-effects model.Behaviorally, BP-I subjects performed equally well as control
participants on the 2-back working memory paradigm. Compared to control participants,
individuals with BP-I were characterized by more sadness-specific activation increases
in the left DLPFC (BA 9/46) and left dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC).Our study documents
sadness-specific abnormalities in the left DLPFC and dACC in bipolar disorder that
suggest difficulties in the integration of emotion (sadness) and cognition. These
preliminary findings require further corroboration with larger sample sizes of medication-free
subjects.
