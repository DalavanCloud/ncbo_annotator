Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study changes in cerebral blood
oxygenation in schizophrenic patients during a verbal fluency task.Five right-handed
male schizophrenic patients and five volunteers matched on demographic variables and
verbal fluency performance participated in the study. Echoplanar images were acquired
over 5 minutes at 1.5 T while the subjects performed two tasks. The first involved
paced silent generation of words beginning with an aurally presented cue letter. This
task alternated with paced silent repetition of the aurally presented word "rest."
Generic brain activation maps were constructed from individual images by sinusoidal
regression and non-parametric hypothesis testing. Between-group differences in the
mean power of experimental response were identified on a voxelwise basis by an analysis
of covariance that controlled for between-group differences in stimulus-correlated
motion.The comparison group showed significant responses in the left prefrontal cortex,
the insula bilaterally, the midline supplementary motor area, and the medial parietal
cortex. Compared to those subjects, the schizophrenic subjects showed significantly
reduced power of response in the left dorsal prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal
gyrus, and the insula but significantly increased power of response in the medial
parietal cortex. In both groups frontal and parietal responses were negatively correlated.Schizophrenic
patients displayed attenuated power of response in several frontal regions during
word generation but greater power of response in the medial parietal cortex during
word r
