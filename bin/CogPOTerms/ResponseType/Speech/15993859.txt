The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) is a region implicated in the assessment
of the rewarding potential of stimuli and may be dysfunctional in major depressive
disorder (MDD). The few studies examining prefrontal cortical responses to emotive
stimuli in MDD have indicated increased VMPFC responses to pleasant images but decreased
responses to sad mood provocation when compared with healthy individuals. We wished
to corroborate these results by examining neural responses to personally relevant
happy and sad stimuli in MDD and healthy individuals within the same paradigm.Neural
responses to happy and sad emotional stimuli (autobiographical memory prompts and
congruent facial expressions) were measured using blood oxygenation level dependent
(BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in MDD (n = 12) and healthy (n
= 12) individuals.Increased and decreased responses in VMPFC were observed in MDD
and healthy individuals, respectively, to happy stimuli, whereas the pattern was reversed
for MDD and healthy individual responses to sad stimuli. These findings were not explained
by medication effects in depressed individuals.These findings indicate a double dissociation
of the pattern of VMPFC response to happy and sad stimuli in depressed and healthy
individuals and suggest abnormal reward processing in MDD.
