Schizophrenia is a diffuse brain disease that affects many facets of cognitive function.
One of the most replicated findings in the neurobiology of schizophrenia is that the
event-related potentials to auditory oddball stimuli are abnormal, effects believed
to be related to abnormalities in attentional and memory processes. Although event-related
potentials provide excellent resolution regarding the time course of information processing,
such studies are poor at characterizing the spatial location of these abnormalities.
To address this issue, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
techniques to elucidate the neural areas underlying target detection in schizophrenia.
Consistent with recent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging results,
target processing by control participants was associated with bilateral activation
in the anterior superior temporal gyri, inferior and superior parietal lobules, and
activation in anterior and posterior cingulate, thalamus, and right lateral frontal
cortex. For the schizophrenic patients, selective deficits were observed in both the
extent and strength of activation associated with target processing in the right lateral
frontal cortex, thalamus, bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus, anterior and
posterior cingulate, and right inferior and superior parietal lobules. These findings
are consistent with the evidence for abnormal processing of oddball stimuli suggested
by event-related potential studies in schizophrenic patients, but provide much more
detailed evidence regarding the anatomical sites implicated. These data are consistent
with the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by a widespread pathological
process affecting many cerebral areas, including association cortex and thalamus.
