Motor symptoms including neurological soft signs have been found to be more prevalent
in schizophrenic patients. In addition, catatonic symptoms and neuroleptic treatment
as well may influence cortical and subcortical motor organization in schizophrenia.
The results of previous neuroimaging studies exploring motor function in patients
with schizophrenia are inhomogenous reporting on a decreased activity in cortical
motor regions in some studies and normal activity in others. Using fMRI, we studied
40 subjects performing a unilateral self-paced fingertapping task. Analyzing a general
linear model of four groups, we compared patients with schizophrenia according to
DSM-IV treated with olanzapine (OL; 10) or haloperidol (HA; 10) to healthy controls
(HC; 10) and untreated patients (UN; 10). Brainvoyager software was used for data
analyzing. In all groups, the contralateral motor cortex was significantly activated.
Significant activation of the ipsilateral cerebellum was found in the UN group, the
control group and the OL group. The contralateral basal ganglia were activated in
UN and in controls. Motor-induced cortical and subcortical brain activation in HC
was significantly higher than in patients with schizophrenia. UN with schizophrenia
showed a significant overactivation than the other groups. In conclusion, we revealed
a diminished activation in the patient group treated with neuroleptic drugs. This
study outlines the importance of further fMRI studies to investigate interindividual
activation differences under different conditions especially focusing on basal ganglia.
