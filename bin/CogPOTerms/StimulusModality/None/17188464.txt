In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of high functioning
outpatients with remitted schizophrenia, we found increased activity compared with
healthy subjects across multiple areas of the brain, including the dorsolateral frontal
cortex and the anterior cingulate, during a modified Stroop task. The same fMRI procedure
was used in this subsequent study to investigate eight unmedicated patients during
an acute episode of schizophrenia and eight healthy control subjects. Patients showed
a reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate and parietal regions
and a higher activation in temporal regions and posterior cingulate compared to healthy
controls. Healthy controls showed a trend towards higher accuracy in the modified
Stroop task compared to schizophrenia patients. Treatment with second generation antipsychotics
may improve executive performance in patients with schizophrenia and facilitate a
normalization of functional hypofrontality after symptomatic improvement.
