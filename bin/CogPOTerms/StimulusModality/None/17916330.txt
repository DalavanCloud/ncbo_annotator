Reduced responsiveness to positive incentives is a central feature of Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD). In the present study, we compared neural correlates of monetary incentive
processing in unmedicated depressed participants and never-depressed control subjects.Fourteen
currently depressed and 12 never-depressed participants underwent functional magnetic
resonance imaging while participating in a monetary incentive delay task. During the
task, participants were cued to anticipate and respond to a rapidly presented target
to gain or avoid losing varying amounts of money.Depressed and never-depressed participants
did not differ in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation or in affective or behavioral
responses during gain anticipation. Depressed participants did, however, exhibit increasing
anterior cingulate activation during anticipation of increasing gains, whereas never-depressed
participants showed increasing anterior cingulate activation during anticipation of
increasing loss. Depressed participants also showed reduced discrimination of gain
versus nongain outcomes.The present findings indicate that although unmedicated depressed
individuals have the capacity to experience positive arousal and recruit NAcc activation
during gain anticipation, they also exhibit increased anterior cingulate cortex activation,
suggestive of increased conflict during anticipation of gains, in addition to showing
reduced discrimination of gain versus nongain outcomes.
