Verbal learning and memory deficits are among the most severe cognitive deficits observed
in schizophrenia. We have demonstrated that such deficits do not extend to working
memory for tones in a substantial number of patients even when verbal working memory
is impaired. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study
the neural basis of this dissociation of auditory verbal and nonverbal working memory
in individuals with schizophrenia.While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging,
12 schizophrenic patients and 12 matched control subjects performed auditory Word
Serial Position Task and Tone Serial Position Task.Both tasks produced activation
in frontal cortex and temporal and parietal lobes of the cerebrum in both groups.
While robust activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (areas 6,
44, and 45) in the control group during the Word Serial Position Task, activation
in the patient group was much reduced in these areas and failed to show the same task-specific
activation as in controls. Reduced activation in patients was not confined to the
inferior frontal gyrus, but also extended to a medial area during the Tone Serial
Position Task and to premotor and anterior temporal lobe areas during both tasks.These
findings support the hypothesis that abnormalities in cortical hemodynamic response
in the inferior frontal gyrus underlie the verbal working memory deficit in schizophrenia.
The relationship of verbal working memory deficits to other cognitive functions suggests
that abnormal functioning in the speech-related areas may reflect a critical substrate
of a broad range of cognitive dysfunctions associated with schizophrenia.
