Working memory (WM) deficits in schizophrenia have been associated with dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) dysfunction in neuroimaging studies. We previously found
increased DLPFC activation in schizophrenic versus normal subjects during WM performance
(Manoach et al 1999b). We now have investigated whether schizophrenic subjects recruit
different brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia and thalamus, components of
frontostriatal circuitry thought to mediate WM.We examined regional brain activation
in nine normal and nine schizophrenic subjects during WM performance using functional
magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects performed a modified version of the Sternberg
Item Recognition Paradigm that included a monetary reward for correct responses. We
compared high and low WM load conditions to each other and to a non-WM baseline condition.
We examined activation in both individual subjects and averaged group data.Relative
to normal subjects, schizophrenic subjects exhibited deficient WM performance, at
least an equal magnitude of right DLPFC activation, significantly greater left DLPFC
activation, and increased spatial heterogeneity of DLPFC activation. Furthermore,
only the schizophrenic group activated the basal ganglia and thalamus, even when matched
for task performance with the normal group.Aberrant WM performance and brain activation
in schizophrenia may reflect dysfunction of frontostriatal circuitry that subserves
WM. Future studies will elucidate the contribution of the anatomical components of
this circuitry to WM deficits.
