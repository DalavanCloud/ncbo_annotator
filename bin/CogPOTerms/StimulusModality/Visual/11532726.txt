The authors examined brain activity associated with the internal monitoring of performance
to test the hypothesis that error-related activity in the anterior cingulate cortex
is impaired in patients with schizophrenia.Seventeen patients with schizophrenia and
16 healthy comparison subjects underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance
imaging during a continuous performance task; stimulus degradation was used to increase
error rates.Comparison subjects, but not schizophrenic patients, showed error-related
activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, and this difference in brain activity was
significantly different across the two groups. Patients also showed less slowing of
reaction time after error commission.Lower error-related activity in the anterior
cingulate cortex and less performance adjustment after error commission are consistent
with the hypothesis that disturbances in anterior cingulate cortex function are related
to a specific alteration in an evaluative component of executive functioning-the internal
monitoring of performance.
