Schizophrenic patients show deficits in working memory (WM) and inhibition of prepotent
responses. We examined brain activity while subjects performed tasks that placed demands
on WM and overriding prepotent response tendencies, testing predictions that both
processes engage overlapping prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions and that schizophrenic
patients show reduced PFC activity and performance deficits reflecting both processes.Functional
magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired while 16 schizophrenic and 15 healthy
subjects performed the N-Back task that varied WM load and a version of the AX-CPT
that required overriding a prepotent response tendency.Both tasks engaged overlapping
cortical networks (e.g., bilateral dorsolateral PFC, Broca's area, parietal cortex).
Increased WM load monotonically increased activity; preparation to override a prepotent
response produced greater and more enduring activity. Group differences on each task
emerged in a right dorsolateral PFC region: schizophrenic subjects showed lesser magnitude
increases under conditions of high WM and prepotent response override demands, with
concomitant performance impairments.Schizophrenic patients exhibit PFC-mediated deficits
in WM and preparation to override prepotent responses. Findings are consistent with
the operation of a single underlying PFC-mediated cognitive control mechanism and
with physiologic dysfunction of the dorsolateral PFC in schizophrenic patients reflecting
impairments in this mechanism.
