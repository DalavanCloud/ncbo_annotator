Numerous neuroimaging studies have examined the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex in schizophrenia; although abnormalities usually are identified, it is unclear
why some studies find too little activation and others too much. The authors' goal
was to explore this phenomenon.They used the N-back working memory task and functional
magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T to examine a group of 14 patients with schizophrenia
and a matched comparison group of 14 healthy subjects.Patients' performance was significantly
worse on the two-back working memory task than that of healthy subjects. However,
there were areas within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the patients that were
more active and areas that were less active than those of the healthy subjects. When
the groups were subdivided on the basis of performance on the working memory task
into healthy subjects and patients with high or low performance, locales of greater
prefrontal activation and locales of less activation were found in the high-performing
patients but only locales of underactivation were found in the low-performing patients.These
findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia whose performance on the N-back
working memory task is similar to that of healthy comparison subjects use greater
prefrontal resources but achieve lower accuracy (i.e., inefficiency) and that other
patients with schizophrenia fail to sustain the prefrontal network that processes
the information, achieving even lower accuracy as a result. These findings add to
other evidence that abnormalities of prefrontal cortical function in schizophrenia
are not reducible to simply too much or too little activity but, rather, reflect a
compromised neural strategy for handling information mediated by the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.
