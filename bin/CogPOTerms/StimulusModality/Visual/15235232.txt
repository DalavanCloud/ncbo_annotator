To demonstrate the functional neuroanatomy associated with sexual arousal visually
evoked in depressed males who have underlying sexual dysfunction using Blood Oxygenation
Level Dependent-based fMRI.Ten healthy volunteers (age range 21-55: mean 32.5 years),
and 10 depressed subjects (age range 23-51: mean 34.4 years, mean Beck Depression
Inventory score of 39.6+/-5.9, mean Hamilton Rating Scale Depression (HAMD)-17 score
of 33.5+/-6.0) with sexual arousal dysfunction viewed erotic and neutral video films
during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 1.5 T MR scanner (GE Signa
Horizon). The fMRI data were obtained from 7 oblique planes using gradient-echo EPI
(flip angle/TR/TE= 90 degrees /6000 ms/50 ms). The visual stimulation paradigm began
with 60 sec of black screen, 150 sec of neutral stimulation with a documentary video
film, 30 sec of black screen, 150 sec of sexual stimulation with an erotic video film
followed by 30 sec of black screen. The brain activation maps and their quantification
were analyzed by SPM99 program.There was a significant difference of brain activation
between two groups during visual sexual stimulation. In depressed subjects, the level
of activation during the visually evoked sexual arousal was significantly less than
that of healthy volunteers, especially in the cerebrocortical areas of the hypothalamus,
thalamus, caudate nucleus, and inferior and superior temporal gyri. On the other hand,
the cerebral activation patterns during the neutral condition in both groups showed
no significant differences (p &lt; 0.01).This study is the first demonstration of the
functional neuroanatomy of the brain associated with sexual dysfunction in depressed
patients using fMRI. In order to validate our physiological neuroscience results,
further studies that would include patients with other disorders and sexual dysfunction,
and depressed patients without sexual dysfunction and their treatment response are
needed.
