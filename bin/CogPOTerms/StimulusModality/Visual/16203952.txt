It remains unclear whether altered regional brain physiological activity in patients
with schizophrenia during working memory tasks relates to maintenance-related processes,
manipulation-related (ie, executive) processes, or both.To examine regional functional
activations of the brain during maintenance- and manipulation-related working memory
processing in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy comparison subjects.Functional
images of the brain were acquired in 11 schizophrenic patients and 12 healthy control
subjects (matched for age, sex, handedness, and parental education) during 2 spatial
working memory paradigms, one contrasting maintenance-only processing with maintenance
and manipulation processing and the other contrasting parametrically varying maintenance
demands.Patients and controls showed activation of a large, spatially distributed
network of cortical and subcortical regions during spatial working memory processing.
When task demands required explicit manipulation of information held in memory, controls
recruited right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 45 and 46) to a significantly
greater extent than patients. A similar effect was observed for the larger memory
set sizes of the memory set size task. No other brain regions showed activation differences
between groups for either task. These differences persisted when comparing activation
maps for memory set sizes in which the 2 groups were equivalent in behavioral accuracy
and when comparing subgroups of patients and controls matched for behavioral accuracy
on either task.Physiological disturbances in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contribute
differentially to patients' difficulties with maintaining spatial information across
a brief delay, as well as with manipulating the maintained representation. These differences
persisted when comparing conditions in which the 2 groups were equivalent in behavioral
accuracy.
