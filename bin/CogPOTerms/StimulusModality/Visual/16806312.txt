Impaired social cognition is a core feature of autism. There is much evidence showing
people with autism use a different cognitive style than controls for face-processing.
We tested if people with autism would show differential activation of social brain
areas during a face-processing task. Thirteen adults with high-functioning autism
or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS) and 13 matched controls. We used fMRI to investigate
'social brain' activity during perception of fearful faces. We employed stimuli known
to reliably activate the amygdala and other social brain areas, and ROI analyses to
investigate brain areas responding to facial threat as well as those showing a linear
response to varying threat intensities. We predicted: (1) the HFA/AS group would show
differential activation (as opposed to merely deficits) of the social brain compared
to controls and (2) that social brain areas would respond to varied intensity of fear
in the control group, but not the HFA/AS group. Both predictions were confirmed. The
controls showed greater activation in the left amygdala and left orbito-frontal cortex,
while the HFA/AS group showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and
superior temporal cortex. The control group also showed varying responses in social
brain areas to varying intensities of fearful expression, including differential activations
in the left and right amygdala. This response in the social brain was absent in the
HFA/AS group. HFA/AS are associated with different patterns of activation of social
brain areas during fearful emotion processing, and the absence in the HFA/AS brain
of a response to varying emotional intensity.
