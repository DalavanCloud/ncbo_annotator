According to cognitive theories, negative cognitions including negative attitudes
towards the future are key factors associated with depressive disorder. We investigated
the neural correlates of anticipation of emotional stimuli in patients with unipolar
depression to reveal influences of future thinking on brain activity. We used functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study 12 female patients with stable antidepressant
medication and 12 healthy women. Subjects were presented with positive, negative and
neutral pictures that were announced by a congruent cue. Subjects were instructed
to expect and subsequently watch the pictures. After scanning, subjects filled the
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) to assess the regulation strategies suppression
and reappraisal. Compared to the healthy control group, during expectation of negative
vs. neutral or positive stimuli the patients showed significantly more activation
within the sublenticular extended dorsal amygdala (SLEA) bilaterally but did not differ
from controls upon expecting positive stimuli. Hamilton depression scores of the patients
correlated positively with activation of the left and right ventral amygdala during
expectation of negative stimuli. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation of ventral
amygdala activation in the patients with reappraisal scores comprising the ability
to limit emotional responding by re-interpreting emotion-eliciting situations. We
interpret enhanced activation in the amygdala/SLEA as a possible consequence of altered
future thinking in patients suffering from depression. Supporting cognitive theories,
this finding does represent evidence that altered cognitions as potentially involved
in expectation result in differences in brain activity.
