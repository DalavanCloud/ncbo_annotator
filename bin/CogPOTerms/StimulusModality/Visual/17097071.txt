Facial emotions are central to human interaction. Identifying pathophysiology in affect
processing circuitry that supports the ability to assess facial emotions might facilitate
understanding of affect regulation in pediatric bipolar disorder.Ten euthymic, unmedicated
pediatric bipolar patients and 10 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender,
race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned with functional magnetic resonance
imaging. Angry, happy, and neutral faces were presented in 30-sec blocks, with a 20-sec
rest period between blocks. Subjects were asked to press a button when each face appeared,
to ensure that attention was maintained on-task.In bipolar patients, in response to
both angry and happy faces relative to neutral faces, we observed reduced activation
of right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex together with increased activity
in right pregenual anterior cingulate, amygdala, and paralimbic cortex. Bipolar patients
also showed reduced activation of visual areas in occipital cortex together with greater
activation in higher-order visual perceptual areas, including superior temporal sulcus
and fusiform gyrus with angry faces and posterior parietal cortex with happy faces.Findings
document a disturbance in affective neurocircuitry in pediatric bipolar disorder.
Reduced activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex might reflect diminished top-down
control that leads to the observed exaggerated activation in amygdala and paralimbic
areas. Changes in occipital areas might represent an effort to gate sensory input
when affective responses to the faces could not be successfully modulated. Disturbances
in affect processing circuitry could contribute to emotional dysregulation and social
cognitive difficulties in bipolar youth.
