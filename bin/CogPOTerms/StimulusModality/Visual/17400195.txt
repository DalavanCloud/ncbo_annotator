People with Asperger syndrome (AS) have life-long deficits in social behavior. The
biological basis of this is unknown, but most likely includes impaired processing
of facial emotion. Human social communication involves processing different facial
emotions, and at different intensities. However nobody has examined brain function
in people with AS when implicitly (unconsciously) processing four primary emotions
at varying emotional intensities.We used event-related functional magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to examine neural responses when people with AS and controls implicitly
processed neutral expressions, and mild (25%) and intense (100%) expressions of fear,
disgust, happiness, and sadness. We included 18 right-handed adults; 9 with AS and
9 healthy controls who did not differ significantly in IQ.Both groups significantly
activated 'face perception' areas when viewing neutral faces, including fusiform and
extrastriate cortices. Further, both groups had significantly increased activation
of fusiform and other extrastriate regions to increasing intensities of fear and happiness.
However, people with AS generally showed fusiform and extrastriate hyporesponsiveness
compared to controls across emotion types and intensities.Fusiform and extrastriate
cortices are activated by facial expressions of four primary emotions in people with
AS, but generally to a lesser degree than controls. This may partly explain the social
impairments of people with AS.
