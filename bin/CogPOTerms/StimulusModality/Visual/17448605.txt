Working memory (WM) deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia. However, it has
not been examined whether these deficits are related to altered temporal dynamics
of information acquisition and changes in executive cognitive control. Therefore,
the present study intended to quantify and model the dynamic process of information
acquisition during continuous overlearning of WM information. It also aimed at investigating
the relation between overlearning-associated change in behavioral performance and
brain activity. Thirteen schizophrenic patients and 13 healthy volunteers were studied
with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a recently developed
overlearning paradigm [Koch K, Wagner G, von Consbruch K, Nenadic I, Schultz C, Ehle
C, Reichenbach J, Sauer H, Schl√∂sser R (2006) Temporal changes in neural activation
during practice of information retrieval from short-term memory: An fMRI study. Brain
Res 1107:140-150]. Consistent with the earlier study, short-term learning of stimulus
material was associated with significant performance improvements and exponential
signal decreases in a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network both in schizophrenic patients
and in healthy volunteers. Against expectation patients exhibited stronger signal
decreases relative to controls in anterior cingulate (Brodmann area (BA) 32), middle
and superior temporal (BA 37, BA 22), superior frontal (BA 8/9, BA 6) and posterior
parietal regions (BA 40). Furthermore, the individually modeled exponential decay
rate of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the right dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex was significantly correlated with exponential decrease in mean behavioral response
times in healthy controls while a statistical trend emerged in patients. A relative
hyperactivation in the patient group was observable only at the start of the learning
process and diminished with continued overlearning. This effect might indicate a gradual
reduction of recruited neuronal resources and a practice-associated activation normalization
in patients with schizophrenia. Our data suggest that in subacute patients learning
and associated decreases in cerebral activation brought about by short-term practice
are left unimpaired.
