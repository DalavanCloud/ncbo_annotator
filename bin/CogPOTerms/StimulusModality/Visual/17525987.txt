Previous research has provided conflicting information regarding the pattern of brain
activation associated with cognitive performance in depressed people. We aimed to
assess brain activation related to cognitive performance during planning and working
memory tasks.fMRI scans were conducted using a modified Tower of London task and a
2-back task in 13 patients with major depressive disorder and a matched control group.Task
performance was impaired in the depressed group on the Tower of London task but there
were no differences between the groups in task performance on the n-back task. The
patient group showed widespread increased brain activation in both tasks. There was
considerable overlap in increased activation between the two tasks, especially in
right prefrontal cortical regions.Patients with depression exhibit increased brain
activation, especially in right prefrontal regions, across several types of cognitive
task activity. Patients with depression may recruit greater brain regions to achieve
similar or even poorer task performance than control subjects.(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss,
