Understanding a speaker's communicative intent in everyday interactions is likely
to draw on cues such as facial expression and tone of voice. Prior research has shown
that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show reduced activity in brain
regions that respond selectively to the face and voice. However, there is also evidence
that activity in key regions can be increased if task demands allow for explicit processing
of emotion.To examine the neural circuitry underlying impairments in interpreting
communicative intentions in ASD using irony comprehension as a test case, and to determine
whether explicit instructions to attend to facial expression and tone of voice will
elicit more normative patterns of brain activity.Eighteen boys with ASD (aged 7-17
years, full-scale IQ &gt;70) and 18 typically developing (TD) boys underwent functional
magnetic resonance imaging at the Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, University
of California, Los Angeles.Blood oxygenation level-dependent brain activity during
the presentation of short scenarios involving irony. Behavioral performance (accuracy
and response time) was also recorded.Reduced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex
and right superior temporal gyrus was observed in children with ASD relative to TD
children during the perception of potentially ironic vs control scenarios. Importantly,
a significant group x condition interaction in the medial prefrontal cortex showed
that activity was modulated by explicit instructions to attend to facial expression
and tone of voice only in the ASD group. Finally, medial prefrontal cortex activity
was inversely related to symptom severity in children with ASD such that children
with greater social impairment showed less activity in this region.Explicit instructions
to attend to facial expression and tone of voice can elicit increased activity in
the medial prefrontal cortex, part of a network important for understanding the intentions
of others, in children with ASD. These findings suggest a strategy for future intervention
research.
