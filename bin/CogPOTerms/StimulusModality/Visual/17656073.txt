Several lines of research suggest both dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortical dysfunction
in bipolar disorder (BD). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare
patterns of brain activation in remitted BD patients and controls whilst performing
tasks selected for their relative specificity in engaging either the dorsal (n-back
sequential-letter working memory task) or ventral (gambling task) PFC. Seven BD patients
were selected from participants of the Maudsley Bipolar Disorder Project on the basis
of clinical remission, absence of cognitive deficits, and monotherapy with mood stabilisers.
Subjects were individually matched by gender, age, and IQ to an equal number of healthy
controls. In the n-back task, group differences were only present in response to increasing
memory load. Patients did not show the predicted dynamic response in the dorsal PFC,
but had increased activation in the parietal cortices. During the gambling task, controls
showed significant activation in the ventral and dorsal PFC; this was attenuated in
BD patients where increased activation was seen in lateral temporal and polar regions.
Our findings suggest that there are trait abnormalities in dorsal and ventral PFC
function in BD that may be more pronounced during tasks that rely on ventral-dorsal
PFC interaction.
