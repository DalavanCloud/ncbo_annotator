Methods of analysis that examine the pattern of cerebral activity over the whole brain
have been used to identify and predict neurocognitive states in healthy individuals.
Such methods may be applied to functional neuroimaging data in patient groups to aid
in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the prediction of treatment response.
We sought to examine the sensitivity and specificity of whole brain pattern classification
of implicit processing of sad facial expressions in depression.Nineteen medication-free
patients with depression and 19 healthy volunteers had been recruited for a functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving serial scans. The fMRI paradigm
entailed incidental affective processing of sad facial stimuli with modulation of
the intensity of the emotional expression (low, medium, and high intensity). The fMRI
data were analyzed at each level of affective intensity with a support vector machine
pattern classification method.The pattern of brain activity during sad facial processing
correctly classified up to 84% of patients (sensitivity) and 89% of control subjects
(specificity), corresponding to an accuracy of 86% (p &lt; .0001). Classification of
patients' clinical response at baseline, prior to the initiation of treatment, showed
a trend toward significance.Significant classification of patients in an acute depressive
episode was achieved with whole brain pattern analysis of fMRI data. The prediction
of treatment response showed a trend toward significance due to the reduced power
of the subsample. Such methods may provide the first steps toward developing neurobiological
markers in psychiatry.
