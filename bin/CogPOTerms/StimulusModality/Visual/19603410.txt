Recent evidence suggests that deficits of working memory may be a promising neurocognitive
endophenotype of bipolar affective disorder. However, little is known about the neurobiological
correlates of these deficits. The aim of this study was to determine possible pathophysiological
trait markers of bipolar disorder in neural circuits involved in working memory. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 18 euthymic bipolar patients and 18 matched
healthy volunteers using two circuit-specific experimental tasks established by prior
systematic neuroimaging studies of working memory. Both euthymic bipolar patients
and healthy controls showed working memory-related brain activations that were highly
consistent with findings from previous comparable neuroimaging studies in healthy
subjects. While these patterns of brain activation were completely preserved in the
bipolar patients, only the patients exhibited activation of the right amygdala during
the articulatory rehearsal task. In the same task, functional activation in right
frontal and intraparietal cortex and in the right cerebellum was significantly enhanced
in the patients. These findings indicate that the right amygdala is pathologically
activated in euthymic bipolar patients during performance of a circuit-specific working
memory task (articulatory rehearsal). This pathophysiological abnormality appears
to be a trait marker in bipolar disorders that can be observed even in the euthymic
state and that seems to be largely independent of task performance and medication.2009
