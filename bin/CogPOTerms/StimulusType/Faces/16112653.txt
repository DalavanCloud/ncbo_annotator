The pathophysiology of abnormal mood states-mania and depression-in patients with
bipolar disorder remains unclear. Facial affect processing paradigms are an effective
way of studying behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) correlates
of affective disorders.We used a factorial design to measure the neural correlates
of tasks, tapping explicit and implicit recognition of sad, fearful, and happy facial
expressions using event-related fMRI paradigms in three groups of participants: eight
bipolar depressed patients, eight bipolar manic patients, and eight control subjects.Depressed
and manic patients exhibited overactivated responses to fearful faces, as well as
to mood-incongruent facial expressions, with the depressed group exhibiting overactivity
in fronto-striato-thalamic systems in response to happy faces and the manic group
exhibiting overactivity in the fusiform gyrus in response to sad faces. For manic
patients, task type also affected the neural response to sad faces, with the corticolimbic
regions showing overactivation for implicit processing and underactivation for explicit
processing.Depressed and manic patients exhibited abnormal neural responses to sad,
fearful, and happy facial expressions. Additionally, the attentional level of sad
facial affect processing has important consequences for abnormalities of amygdala
and cingulate activation in manic patients.
