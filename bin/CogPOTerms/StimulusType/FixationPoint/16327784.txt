To examine mirror neuron abnormalities in autism, high-functioning children with autism
and matched controls underwent fMRI while imitating and observing emotional expressions.
Although both groups performed the tasks equally well, children with autism showed
no mirror neuron activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Notably,
activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain,
suggesting that a dysfunctional 'mirror neuron system' may underlie the social deficits
observed in autism.
