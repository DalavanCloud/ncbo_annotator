Previously we proposed that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports a specific
working memory (WM) subcomponent: the ability to represent and maintain context information
necessary to guide appropriate task behavior. By context, we mean prior task-relevant
information represented in such a form that it supports selection of the appropriate
behavioral response. Furthermore, we hypothesized that WM deficits in schizophrenia
reflect impaired context processing due to a disturbance in dorsolateral PFC. We use
functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine PFC activation in medication-naive,
first-episode patients with schizophrenia during a WM, task-isolating context processing.Fourteen
first-episode, medication-naive patients with schizophrenia and 12 controls similar
in age, sex, and parental education underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
during performance of an A-X version of the Continuous Performance Test.Patients with
schizophrenia demonstrated deficits in dorsolateral PFC activation in task conditions
requiring context processing but showed intact activation of posterior and inferior
PFC. In addition, patients demonstrated intact activation of the primary motor and
somatosensory cortex in response to stimulus processing demands.These results demonstrate
selectivity in dorsolateral PFC dysfunction among medication-naive first-episode patients
with schizophrenia, suggesting that a specific deficit in PFC function is present
at illness onset, prior to the administration of medication or the most confounding
effects of illness duration. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the hypothesis
that WM deficits in patients with schizophrenia reflect an impairment in context processing
due to a disturbance in dorsolateral PFC function.
