The results of one randomised control trial testing a psychological rehabilitation
programme aimed at information processing strategies showed improvements in cognition
post-treatment.To determine whether there are concomitant brain activation changes
as a result of engaging in cognitive remediation therapy (CRT).Three groups (patients
receiving control therapy or CRT and a healthy control group) were investigated in
a repeated measures design using the two-back test. Functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data and a broad assessment of executive functioning were completed
at baseline and post-treatment. Brain activation changes were identified after accounting
for possible task-correlated motion artefact.fMRI analyses indicate that the control
group showed decreased activation but the two patient groups showed an increase in
activation over time. The patient group that received successful CRT had significantly
increased brain activation in regions associated with working memory, particularly
the frontocortical areas.This is the first time that brain activation changes in a
seriously disabled group of patients with schizophrenia can be associated clearly
with psychological rather than pharmacological therapy.
