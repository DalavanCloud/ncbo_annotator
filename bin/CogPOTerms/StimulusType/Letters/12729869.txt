Hypofrontality and decreased lateralization have been two major, albeit controversial,
results from functional neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia. We used fMRI to study
cortical activation during a verbal and spatial working memory (WM) task (2-back)
in 15 inpatients acutely ill with schizophrenia and 15 matched control subjects. We
hypothesized (i) hypofrontality in patients in both tasks and (ii) decreased lateralization
of prefrontal activation in patients under the assumption that, in controls, left
prefrontal cortex (PFC) is engaged preferentially in the verbal task (verbal domain
dominance) and the right prefrontal cortex is engaged preferentially in the spatial
task (spatial domain dominance). Our results showed no significant differences in
frontal activation between controls and patients, i.e. no hypofrontality in patients,
even at a very liberal threshold (p&lt;0.01). This may be explained by the fact that
nearly all patients studied received atypical neuroleptics. Nonetheless, we found
evidence for more subtle, domain-related prefrontal dysfunction. Whereas controls
showed verbal WM domain dominance in left inferior frontal cortex and spatial WM domain
dominance in right prefrontal cortex, these domain dominance effects were absent in
the patient group, i.e. there were no lateralization effects. Finally, only patients
showed an inverse correlation between performance and right prefrontal activation
in verbal WM. We conclude that the finding of hypofrontality may depend on the medication
of the patients and that there is prefrontal dysfunction even in the absence of hypofrontality.
