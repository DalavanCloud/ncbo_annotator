Previous studies have reported evidence of structural and functional abnormalities
in the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with schizophrenia.The authors studied
19 male patients with chronic schizophrenia and 15 healthy male comparison subjects
with functional magnetic resonance imaging and the novel Multi-Source Interference
Task, a task designed to elicit robust dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation
in individual subjects. Group averaged and individual (region-of-interest-based) brain
activation patterns were compared during the performance of control and interference
trials.Performance (reaction times and accuracy) did not differ between healthy subjects
and patients with schizophrenia. Comparison of interference and neutral blocks revealed
activation in the medial wall of the prefrontal cortex in 93% (N=14) of the healthy
subjects and 84% (N=16) of the subjects with schizophrenia. Sixty-seven percent (N=10)
of the healthy subjects but only 16% (N=3) of the subjects with schizophrenia displayed
maximum medial wall activation within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.The Multi-Source
Interference Task produced robust activation in the medial wall of the prefrontal
cortex during cognitive interference. Analysis of individual activation patterns revealed
medial wall abnormalities in schizophrenia patients.
