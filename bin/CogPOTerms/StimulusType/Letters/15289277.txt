The neurobiological features of pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) are largely unknown.
Children and adolescents with BD may be important to study with functional neuroimaging
techniques because of their unique status of early-onset BD and high familial loading
for the disorder. Neuroimaging studies of adults with BD have implicated the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the development of
this disorder.To study children and adolescents with BD via functional magnetic resonance
imaging using cognitive and affective tasks and to examine possible abnormalities
in the DLPFC and ACC, as well as selected subcortical areas, in pediatric familial
BD.We evaluated 12 male subjects aged 9 to 18 years with BD who had at least 1 parent
with BD as well as 10 age- and IQ-matched healthy male controls. Stimulants were discontinued
for at least 24 hours; other medications were continued. Subjects underwent functional
magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T while performing a 2-back visuospatial working memory
task and an affective task involving the visualization of positively, neutrally, or
negatively valenced pictures.An academic referral setting, drawing from the Bay Area
of San Francisco, Calif.Compared with controls, for the visuospatial working memory
task, subjects with BD had greater activation in several areas including the bilateral
ACC, left putamen, left thalamus, left DLPFC, and right inferior frontal gyrus. Controls
had greater activation in the cerebellar vermis. In viewing negatively valenced pictures,
subjects with BD had greater activation in the bilateral DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus,
and right insula. Controls had greater activation in the right posterior cingulate
gyrus. For positively valenced pictures, subjects with BD had greater activation in
the bilateral caudate and thalamus, left middle/superior frontal gyrus, and left ACC,
whereas controls had no areas of greater activation.Children and adolescents with
BD may have underlying abnormalities in the regulation of prefrontal-subcortical circuits.
Further functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of attention and mood with greater
sample sizes are needed.
