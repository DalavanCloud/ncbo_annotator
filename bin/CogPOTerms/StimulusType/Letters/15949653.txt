Patients with schizophrenia frequently demonstrate hypofrontality in tasks that require
executive processing; however questions still remain as to whether prefrontal cortex
dysfunctions are specific to schizophrenia, or a general feature of major psychopathology.
Context processing is conceptualized as an executive function associated with attention
and working memory processes. Impairment in the ability of patients with schizophrenia
to represent and maintain context information has been previously reported in a number
of studies. To examine the question of the specificity of a context processing deficit
to schizophrenia, we used functional MRI and an expectancy AX continuous performance
task designed to assess context processing in a group of healthy controls (n=9), depressed
patient controls (n=10), and patients with schizophrenia (n=7). The behavioral performance
was consistent with a context processing deficit in patients with schizophrenia, but
not those with depression. The imaging data replicate previous results in showing
abnormal activity in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA9) in schizophrenia patients
related to context processing.
