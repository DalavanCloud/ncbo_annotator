Several neuroimaging studies have reported 'hypofrontality' in depressed patients
performing a cognitive challenge compared to control subjects. Hypofrontality in depression
is likely associated with an impaired behavioral performance. It is unclear whether
this impaired performance is the consequence or the cause of hypofrontality. Consequently,
we proposed to compare the cerebral activity of depressed patients and healthy subjects
while controlling for the level of performance. Ten individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria
for Major Depression and 10 healthy controls were tested with a verbal version of
the n-back task during fMRI scanning. The working memory load was manipulated across
the experiment (1,2,3-back) to increase the cognitive demands. fMRI data were acquired
on a 1.5-T GE scanner and analyzed using SPM99 software. We did not find any difference
between groups in both performance and reaction times for each level of complexity
of the n-back task. Depressed patients and control subjects showed bilateral activation
of the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Activation
of these regions was modulated by the complexity of the task. Within this n-back neural
network, depressed patients showed greater activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex
and the anterior cingulate compared to healthy subjects. This study provides evidence
that depressed patients need greater activation within the same neural network to
maintain a similar level of performance as controls during a working memory task.
Our findings suggest that depression may impair the cognitive capacity of depressed
patients by recruiting more brain resources than controls during cognitive control.
