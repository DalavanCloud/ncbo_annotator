This study aimed to assess the neurophysiological effects of acute atypical antipsychotic
treatment on cognitive functioning in subjects presenting with a first episode of
psychosis. We used functional MRI to examine the modulatory effects of acute psychopharmacological
intervention on brain activation during four different cognitive tasks: overt verbal
fluency, random movement generation, n-back and a spatial object memory task. Treatment
with atypical antipsychotics was associated with alterations in regional activation
during each task and also when task demands were manipulated within paradigms. The
initial treatment of psychosis with atypical antipsychotics thus appears to be associated
with modifications of the neurofunctional correlates of executive and mnemonic functions.
These effects need to be considered when interpreting group differences in activation
between medicated patients and controls.
