Abnormal language processing is a consistent finding in bipolar disorder (BD). We
used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the core components
of language processing as well as the impact of task demand in a group of bipolar
subjects.Twelve euthymic dextral male BD I participants receiving lithium monotherapy
were matched with 12 controls. Groups were matched for age, years of education and
estimated premorbid IQ. We employed a factorial design manipulating task demand (decision
versus fluency) and task domain (phonetic versus semantic) to investigate differences
in language processing between groups and across different task domains and requirements.
Data were fitted to haemodynamic response models convolved to the experimental design.
Group and task difference maps were generated.During the scanning session bipolar
patients demonstrated significantly slower reaction times. However, groups demonstrated
the same task accuracy except for one domain (phonetic decision). All participants
activated regions known to be engaged by language tasks, but compared to controls
the bipolar patients showed altered patterns of prefrontal activation which were related
to the nature of the task, language processing, and increasing task demand.We have
demonstrated abnormal prefrontal activation in bipolar patients across a range of
language tasks with varying task demands.
