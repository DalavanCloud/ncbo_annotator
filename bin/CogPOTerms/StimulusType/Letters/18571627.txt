There is evidence that patients with bipolar disorder have working memory deficits
even during periods of euthymia. The neural basis of such deficits and its relationship
with genetic risk remain unclear. We utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to investigate neural activity in samples of bipolar disorder patients and
their unaffected first-degree relatives while performing working memory tasks of increasing
difficulty.Twenty remitted bipolar I disorder patients, 20 of their unaffected first-degree
relatives, and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited and successfully completed scanning.
Subjects participated in fMRI scans consisting of an n-back working memory task with
three stages of increasing difficulty (1-back, 2-back, and 3-back), alternating with
a baseline attention task. Groups were analyzed separately to produce brain activation
maps, and a group-by-task analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc comparisons was
completed.Patients performed more poorly online than control subjects and relatives
on the 2-back and 3-back tasks. The group-by-task ANOVA demonstrated a significantly
altered region of neural activity involving a cluster located in the left frontal
pole/ventrolateral gyrus. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that this cluster was accounted
for by significantly greater activation in relatives compared with control subjects
for the 2-back task. Patients demonstrated a trend to significantly greater activation
than control subjects in the same cluster during 1-back performance.Left prefrontal
hyperactivation during working memory is associated with genetic liability for bipolar
disorder and represents a potential neurobiological endophenotype for the illness.
