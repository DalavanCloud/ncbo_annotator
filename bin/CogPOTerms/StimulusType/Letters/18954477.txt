Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by language
and communication impairments, social impairments, and repetitive behaviors or restricted
interests. Previous studies of semantic functions have found differences in semantic
processing and differences in the activation of the language network in adults with
ASD compared to controls. The goal of this study is to examine semantic functions
in adolescents with ASD compared to typically developing adolescents. We utilized
fMRI with a reading version of a response-naming task to investigate activation in
12 right-handed adolescent boys with ASD and 12 typically developing boys. Both groups
performed the task at ceiling levels. Boys with ASD had significantly stronger activation
than controls in Broca's area, which was less left lateralized in ASD individuals.
Controls had a significant correlation between frontal and temporal language area
activation in the left hemisphere, whereas ASD adolescents did not. Direct group comparisons
revealed additional regions activated in the ASD group relative to the control group.
These results suggest differences in semantic organization, approaches to the semantic
task, or efficiency in semantic processing in ASD adolescents relative to typically
developing adolescents.
