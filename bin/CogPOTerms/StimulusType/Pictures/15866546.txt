Functional imaging studies indicate that imbalances in cortico-limbic activity and
connectivity may underlie the pathophysiology of MDD. In this study, using functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we investigated differences in cortico-limbic activity
and connectivity between depressed patients and healthy controls.Fifteen unmedicated
unipolar depressed patients and 15 matched healthy subjects underwent fMRI during
which they first completed a conventional block-design activation experiment in which
they were exposed to negative and neutral pictures. Next, low frequency blood oxygenation
dependent (BOLD) related fluctuations (LFBF) data were acquired at rest and during
steady-state exposure to neutral, positive and negative pictures. LFBF correlations
were calculated between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and limbic regions--amygdala
(AMYG), pallidostriatum (PST) and medial thalamus (MTHAL) and used as a measure of
cortico-limbic connectivity.Depressed patients had increased activation of cortical
and limbic regions. At rest and during exposure to neutral, positive, and negative
pictures cortico-limbic LFBF correlations were decreased in depressed patients compared
to healthy subjects.The finding of increased activation of limbic regions and decreased
LFBF correlations between ACC and limbic regions is consistent with the hypothesis
that decreased cortical regulation of limbic activation in response to negative stimuli
may be present in depression.
