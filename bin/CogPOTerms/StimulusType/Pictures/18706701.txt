Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by aberrant amygdala responses
to sad stimuli and poor cognitive control, but the interactive effects of these impairments
are poorly understood.To evaluate brain activation in MDD in response to cognitive
control stimuli embedded within sad and neutral contexts.Fourteen adults with MDD
and fifteen matched controls participated in a mixed block/event-related functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task that presented oddball target stimuli embedded
within blocks of sad or neutral images.Target events activated similar prefrontal
brain regions in both groups. However, responses to target events embedded within
blocks of emotional images revealed a clear group dissociation. During neutral blocks,
the control group demonstrated greater activation to targets in the midfrontal gyrus
and anterior cingulate relative to the MDD group, replicating previous findings of
prefrontal hypo-activation in MDD samples to cognitive control stimuli. However, during
sad blocks, the MDD group demonstrated greater activation in a number of prefrontal
regions, including the mid-, inferior, and orbito-frontal gyri and the anterior cingulate,
suggesting that relatively more prefrontal brain activation was required to disengage
from the sad images to respond to the target events.A larger sample size would have
provided greater statistical power, and more standardized stimuli would have increased
external validity.This double dissociation of prefrontal responses to target events
embedded within neutral and sad context suggests that MDD impacts not only responses
to affective events, but extends to other cognitive processes carried out in the context
of affective engagement. This implies that emotional reactivity to sad events in MDD
may impact functioning more broadly than previously understood.
