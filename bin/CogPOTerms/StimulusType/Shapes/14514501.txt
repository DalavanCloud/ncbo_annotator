Autism is a neurally based psychiatric disorder, but there is no consensus regarding
the underlying neurofunctional abnormalities. Previous functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies of simple movement suggested individually variable and scattered
functional brain organization in autism. The authors examined whether such abnormalities
generalize to multimodal processing (visually driven motor sequence learning).Eight
male autistic patients and eight comparison subjects matched with the patients on
age, gender, and handedness were examined by using fMRI while they performed finger
press movements prompted by visually presented repeating six-digit sequences. Hemodynamic
responses to the six-digit sequences were statistically compared to responses to single-digit
stimuli in one experiment and to regular six-digit sequences in another experiment.Both
groups showed activations in bilateral premotor, superior parietal, and occipital
cortices in both experiments. Task-by-group interactions showed that superior parietal
activations were less pronounced in the autism group, whereas prefrontal cortex and
more posterior parietal loci showed greater activation in the autism group than in
the comparison group. The distances between Individual subjects' activation peaks
and the groupwise peak were greater in the autism group than in the comparison group.The
results support earlier findings of abnormal variability and scatter of functional
maps in autism. They are consistent with evidence from other studies suggesting early-onset
disturbances in the development of cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways in autism.
