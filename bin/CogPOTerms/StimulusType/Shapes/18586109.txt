Depressed individuals show hypersensitivity to negative feedback during cognitive
testing, which can precipitate subsequent errors and thereby impair a broad range
of cognitive abilities. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying this feedback
hypersensitivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a reversal
learning task that required subjects to ignore misleading negative feedback on some
trials. Thirteen depressed subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), 12 depressed
subjects with bipolar disorder (BD) and 15 healthy controls participated. The MDD
group, but not the BD group, demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to negative feedback
compared to controls, as indicated by the rates of rule reversal following misleading
negative feedback. In the control and BD groups, hemodynamic activity was significantly
higher in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices during reversal shifting,
and significantly lower in the right amygdala in response to negative feedback. The
extent to which the amygdala showed less activity during negative feedback correlated
inversely with the behavioral tendency to reverse after misleading feedback. This
effect was not present in the MDD group, who also failed to recruit the prefrontal
cortex during behavioral reversal. Hypersensitivity to negative feedback is present
in unmedicated depressed patients with MDD. Disrupted top-down control by the prefrontal
cortex of the amygdala may underlie this abnormal response to negative feedback in
unipolar depression.
