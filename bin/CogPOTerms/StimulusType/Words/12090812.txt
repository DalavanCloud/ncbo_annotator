Mood-congruent processing biases are among the most robust research findings in neuropsychological
studies of depression. Depressed patients show preferential processing of negatively
toned stimuli across a range of cognitive tasks. The present study aimed to determine
whether these behavioral abnormalities are associated with specific neural substrates.Ten
depressed patients and 11 healthy control subjects underwent scanning during performance
of an emotional go/no-go task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task
allowed comparison among neural response to happy, sad, and neutral words, in the
context of these words as targets (ie, stimuli to which subjects were required to
make a motor response) or distractors (ie, stimuli to which the motor response was
withheld).Depressed patients showed attenuated neural responses to emotional relative
to neutral targets in ventral cingulate and posterior orbitofrontal cortices. However,
patients showed elevated responses specific to sad targets in rostral anterior cingulate
extending to anterior medial prefrontal cortex. Unlike controls, patients showed differential
neural response to emotional, particularly sad, distractors in the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex.These findings suggest a distinct neural substrate for mood-congruent processing
biases in performance. The medial and orbital prefrontal regions may play a key role
in mediating the interaction between mood and cognition in affective disorder.
