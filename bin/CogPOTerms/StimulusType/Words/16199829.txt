People with schizophrenia have exhibited reduced functional activity in the anterior
cingulate cortex during the performance of many types of cognitive tasks and during
the commission of errors. According to conflict theory, the anterior cingulate cortex
is involved in the monitoring of response conflict, acting as a signal for a need
for greater cognitive control. This study examined whether impaired conflict monitoring
in people with schizophrenia could underlie reduced anterior cingulate activity during
both correct task performance and error-related activity.Functional activity in the
anterior cingulate of 13 schizophrenia patients and 13 healthy comparison subjects
was investigated by using event-related fMRI and a Stroop task that allowed simultaneous
examination of activity during both conflict (incongruent trials) and error (commission
of error trials).In the presence of comparable reaction time measures for conflict
as well as comparable error rates, the schizophrenia subjects showed both decreased
conflict- and error-related activity in the same region of the anterior cingulate
cortex. Moreover, those with schizophrenia did not exhibit significant post-conflict
or post-error behavioral adjustments.Concurrently reduced conflict- and error-related
activity in the anterior cingulate cortex along with reduced trial-to-trial adjustments
in performance has not previously been reported in schizophrenia. The current results
suggest that impaired conflict monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex might play
an important role in contributing to cognitive control deficits in patients with schizophrenia.
