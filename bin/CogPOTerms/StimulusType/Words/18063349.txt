Several studies have implicated the involvement of two major components of emotion
regulatory networks, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and amygdala, in
the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In healthy subjects, the VLPFC has been shown
to negatively modulate amygdala response when subjects cognitively evaluate an emotional
face by identifying and labeling the emotion it expresses. The current study used
such a paradigm to assess whether the strength of this modulation was altered in bipolar
subjects when manic. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), nine manic
subjects with bipolar I disorder and nine healthy subjects either named the emotion
shown in a face by identifying one of two words that correctly expressed the emotion
(emotion labeling task) or matched the emotion shown in a face to one of two other
faces (emotion perception task). The degree to which the VLPFC regulated amygdala
response during these tasks was assessed using a psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
analysis. Compared with healthy subjects, manic patients had a significantly reduced
VLPFC regulation of amygdala response during the emotion labeling task. These findings,
taken in context with previous fMRI studies of bipolar mania, suggest that reductions
in inhibitory frontal activity in these patients may lead to an increased reactivity
of the amygdala.
