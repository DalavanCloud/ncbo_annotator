Earlier imaging studies in schizophrenia have reported abnormal amygdala and prefrontal
cortex activity during emotion processing. We investigated with functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) during emotion processing changes in activity of the amygdala
and of prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia during 8 weeks of olanzapine
treatment. Twelve previously drug-free/naive patients with schizophrenia were treated
with olanzapine for 8 weeks and underwent two fMRI scans after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment
during implicit and explicit emotional processing. Twelve healthy subjects were also
scanned twice to control for potential repetition effects. Results showed a diagnosis
by time interaction in left amygdala and a diagnosis by time by task interaction in
right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In particular, activity in left amygdala was
greater in patients than in controls at the first scan during both explicit and implicit
processing, while it was lower in patients at the second relative to the first scan.
Furthermore, during implicit processing, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity
was lower in patients than controls at the first scan, while it was greater in patients
at the second relative to the first scan. These results suggest that longitudinal
treatment with olanzapine may be associated with specific changes in activity of the
amygdala and prefrontal cortex during emotional processing in schizophrenia.
